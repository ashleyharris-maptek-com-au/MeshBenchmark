prompt = """
You are given 5 rigid lengths of pipe, each 5 meters long and 10cm in diameter. 

One pipe is fixed with its center at the origin (0,0) and a rotation of 0, meaning its length is along the x-axis, and it
spans from -2.5,-0.05 to 2.5, 0.05.

Arrange the remaining 4 pipes on a 2D plane such that the the pipes resemble a "H" shape when viewed from above.

Return a 5 element array of where each of the pipes are located:
