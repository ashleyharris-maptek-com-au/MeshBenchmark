{'reasoning': 'The grid contains 6 diamond-like shapes. By analyzing the pixel coordinates, each shape can be approximated by a circle in the 2x-scaled coordinate space, specifically defined by the inequality (2x - cx)^2 + (2y - cy)^2 <= 9. The centers (cx, cy) in the scaled space are located at (69, 6), (15, 20), (41, 20), (67, 20), (63, 42), and (43, 72). To satisfy the requirement of a single polynomial-like function (using arithmetic operations) that is positive inside these regions and negative outside, a sum of inverse quadratic functions (metaballs) is used. Each term 100 / (d^2 + 1) contributes ~10 inside the shape (d^2<=9) and ~7 outside (d^2>=13). Summing these and subtracting a threshold of 9 provides the correct segmentation.', 'function': 'def f(x, y):\n    return 100/((2*x - 69)**2 + (2*y - 6)**2 + 1) + 100/((2*x - 15)**2 + (2*y - 20)**2 + 1) + 100/((2*x - 41)**2 + (2*y - 20)**2 + 1) + 100/((2*x - 67)**2 + (2*y - 20)**2 + 1) + 100/((2*x - 63)**2 + (2*y - 42)**2 + 1) + 100/((2*x - 43)**2 + (2*y - 72)**2 + 1) - 9'}
