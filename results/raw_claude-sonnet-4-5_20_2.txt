{'reasoningAndDiscussion': "I need to create a parametric shape function for Australia including Tasmania. The key requirements are:\n\n1. Function f(x,y) where >0 is inside, <=0 is outside\n2. Use Mercator projection\n3. Fit within 0,0 -> 1,1 normalized space\n4. Under 4096 bytes\n5. Include Tasmania\n\nApproach:\n- Use a polygon-based approach with key coordinates of Australia's outline\n- Apply Mercator projection: x = longitude, y = ln(tan(π/4 + latitude/2))\n- Use point-in-polygon test (ray casting or winding number)\n- Define mainland Australia and Tasmania as separate polygons\n- Normalize coordinates to 0-1 range\n\nFor compactness:\n- Use short variable names\n- Compress coordinate data\n- Use numpy for efficiency\n- Implement simple point-in-polygon test\n\nI'll use a simplified outline with key points around Australia's coast, converting lat/lon to Mercator, then normalizing. The function will check if a point is inside either the mainland or Tasmania polygon.", 'minifiedCode': 'def f(x,y):\n P=[(153.6,-28.2),(153.5,-28.9),(153.3,-29.4),(153.1,-30.1),(152.9,-31.5),(152.5,-32.0),(151.6,-33.0),(151.2,-33.9),(150.7,-34.4),(150.5,-35.1),(150.1,-35.7),(149.9,-36.7),(149.8,-37.5),(149.9,-38.0),(149.4,-38.3),(148.3,-38.7),(147.7,-39.0),(147.4,-39.9),(146.9,-40.8),(146.4,-41.1),(145.5,-41.1),(145.0,-40.8),(144.7,-40.6),(144.0,-40.4),(143.0,-40.0),(142.0,-38.5),(141.0,-38.0),(140.9,-37.8),(140.8,-36.6),(140.8,-35.0),(140.8,-33.0),(140.8,-31.0),(140.8,-26.0),(140.8,-19.0),(140.9,-17.5),(141.3,-16.2),(141.6,-14.2),(141.9,-12.5),(142.1,-11.6),(142.5,-11.1),(142.9,-10.9),(143.1,-11.9),(143.5,-12.4),(143.9,-13.3),(144.5,-14.2),(145.2,-14.9),(145.5,-15.5),(145.8,-16.5),(145.9,-16.9),(146.2,-17.8),(146.5,-18.3),(147.0,-18.9),(147.5,-19.3),(148.2,-19.8),(148.7,-20.3),(149.1,-21.0),(149.5,-21.5),(149.9,-22.3),(150.5,-22.5),(150.8,-23.5),(151.6,-24.1),(152.3,-24.8),(152.9,-25.5),(153.3,-26.3),(153.4,-27.1),(153.5,-27.6)];T=[(148.3,-43.5),(148.0,-42.8),(147.5,-43.2),(147.2,-43.6),(146.8,-43.6),(146.0,-43.5),(145.5,-43.1),(145.0,-42.5),(144.7,-42.0),(144.7,-41.5),(145.0,-41.0),(145.5,-40.7),(146.5,-40.5),(147.5,-40.3),(148.0,-40.5),(148.3,-40.9),(148.4,-41.4),(148.3,-42.0),(148.2,-42.7),(148.3,-43.5)];C=[(113.1,-26.0),(113.5,-22.0),(114.0,-21.5),(114.5,-20.5),(115.0,-20.0),(116.0,-19.5),(117.0,-19.0),(118.5,-18.5),(119.5,-18.0),(120.5,-18.5),(121.5,-19.0),(122.5,-18.5),(123.0,-17.5),(123.5,-17.0),(124.0,-16.5),(125.0,-16.0),(125.5,-15.5),(126.0,-15.0),(127.0,-14.5),(128.0,-14.0),(129.0,-13.5),(130.0,-12.5),(131.0,-12.0),(132.0,-11.5),(133.0,-11.5),(134.0,-12.0),(135.0,-12.3),(136.0,-12.5),(136.5,-13.5),(136.8,-14.5),(137.0,-16.0),(137.5,-17.5),(138.0,-18.5),(138.5,-20.0),(138.8,-22.0),(139.0,-24.0),(139.5,-26.0),(140.0,-29.0),(140.5,-31.0),(140.8,-33.0),(140.8,-35.0),(140.8,-36.6),(140.8,-37.8),(137.5,-35.5),(135.0,-35.0),(133.0,-35.5),(131.0,-34.5),(129.0,-33.5),(127.0,-32.8),(125.0,-33.0),(123.0,-33.5),(121.0,-34.0),(119.0,-34.5),(117.5,-34.8),(116.0,-35.0),(115.0,-34.5),(114.5,-33.5),(114.0,-32.0),(113.5,-30.0),(113.2,-28.0),(113.1,-26.0)];A=P+C\n def m(n,o):return(n,(numpy.log(numpy.tan(numpy.pi/4+numpy.radians(o)/2)) if abs(o)<89.9 else numpy.sign(o)*10))\n M=[m(n,o)for n,o in A];T=[m(n,o)for n,o in T];X=[p[0]for p in M];Y=[p[1]for p in M];mn_x=min(X);mx_x=max(X);mn_y=min(Y);mx_y=max(Y);M=[((p[0]-mn_x)/(mx_x-mn_x),(p[1]-mn_y)/(mx_y-mn_y))for p in M];T=[((p[0]-mn_x)/(mx_x-mn_x),(p[1]-mn_y)/(mx_y-mn_y))for p in T]\n def i(p,q,P):\n n=len(P);c=0\n for j in range(n):\n a,b=P[j];d,e=P[(j+1)%n]\n if((b>q)!=(e>q))and(p<(d-a)*(q-b)/(e-b)+a):c+=1\n return c%2==1\n return 1.0 if(i(x,y,M)or i(x,y,T))else -1.0'}
