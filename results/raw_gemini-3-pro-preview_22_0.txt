A single burn changes the inclination (approx 37 degrees) and lowers the periapsis to Station 0's altitude (7000km). At periapsis (approx 6264s), a circularization burn matches Station 0's velocity. This direct method (approx 4.7 km/s total) is cheaper than a bi-elliptic transfer for this inclination change (<39 deg).\n\n2. **Station 0 to Station 1**: The relative inclination is large (58 degrees). A bi-elliptic transfer is optimal. The ship coasts to the appropriate node relative to Station 1's plane (7553s) and performs a burn to raise the apogee to 500,000 km. At this high apogee, the plane change is performed for negligible Delta-V (approx 0.15 km/s). The ship falls back to 7000km and circularizes to match Station 1. This saves over 1 km/s compared to a direct plane change."}
