Here is an 12x12 grid representing a space partition:

########....
######......
####........
###.........
###.........
##..........
##..........
#...........
............
............
............
............

0, 0 is the top left, x is horizontal, y is vertical. Coordinates are in integers.

Using the formula:

let cell = 

   # if f(x,y) > 0
   . if f(x,y) <= 0

where f(x,y) is a polynomial of whatever degree you need to solve this. You can include cross terms like x*y, x**2*y, x*y**2, etc.

Return the formula as python function f(x,y) that uses ONLY:
- arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- powers (**) 
- parentheses for grouping
- integer coordinates x, y
- the words "def" and "return"

Do not use type annotations, casts, conditionals, branches, additional variables, comments or anything else.

You can use the following example as a template:

def f(x, y):
    return x**2 + 3*y**2 - 4*x*y - 145

DO NOT OUTPUT ANYTHING ELSE THAN THE FUNCTION.
