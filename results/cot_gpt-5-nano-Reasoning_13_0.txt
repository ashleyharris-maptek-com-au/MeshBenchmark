**Evaluating sniper position and visibility**

I’m considering the sniper's position at (100,100,20) and the need to position four people on the ground at z=0. They must stay within 30 meters of the building's center at (0,0) without overlapping. So, their distances from (0,0) need to be less or equal to 30. The building is obstructing the sniper's line of sight to them. I'll need to ensure that the line from the sniper to each position intersects the building's volume.**Analyzing visibility and positioning**

I’m looking at how the sniper's view from (100,100,20) is obstructed by the building at the origin, which spans from (-1,1) in both x and y, and z is up to 10. I need to ensure that the chosen positions for diners are completely occluded by the building, while also making sure they don't overlap with it or each other. Each box for the positions has a footprint of 0.5x0.5 and occupies the z-range from 0 to 2. Thus, they shouldn’t overlap either with the building or each other, considering the space occupied is [-1,1] by [-1,1].**Positioning boxes without overlap**

Each person will have a footprint of 0.5x0.5, and I need to arrange four such boxes so that their volumes don’t intersect with the building. The building height is 10, so the boxes should extend from z=0 to z=2 but not overlap with the building's bounding box. This means their x and y coordinates must be outside the building's footprint on the ground, which spans from (-1,1) in both dimensions. Therefore, to avoid overlap, the center x-coordinate must be positioned such that the boxes stay clear of the building's edges.**Avoiding overlap with the building**

Since the building's height ranges from 0 to 10 and the person's boxes extend from z=0 to z=2, any vertical overlap of their footprints would lead to intersection. To avoid this, the x and y coordinates of the person's boxes need to be positioned so that their edges are outside the building's footprint of (-1,1) in both coordinates. Specifically, for no overlap, the boxes’ extents (0.25 in each direction) must sit entirely outside that (-1,1) square in x and y.**Ensuring proper positioning and visibility**

To avoid intersections, the 2D projections of each person's box must not overlap with the building's footprint. For there to be any intersection, both the x and y intervals for the boxes need to overlap as well, especially since the building extends vertically. I need to place each person’s box outside the building's footprint and also ensure that they are positioned behind the building relative to the sniper's view from (100,100,20). This way, their lines of sight will intersect the building and maintain visibility constraints.**Analyzing occlusion requirements**

The line from the sniper at (100,100,20) to a point P can potentially intersect the building's volume, especially if P is positioned near the origin. For occlusion, P must be located such that the line from S to P crosses through the building’s footprint. If P is too far to the east or north, it risks missing the building altogether. I want to ensure that P's coordinates allow the line segment to intersect within the building’s boundaries by placing them appropriately behind the building while considering all distance constraints.**Assessing visibility and occlusion**

I'm working through the parameters for ensuring occlusion when positioning points P around the building. The line from the sniper's position to each P must intersect the building's volume while also keeping P's footprint outside of it. If I place P at coordinates like (-5,-5), then the line from the sniper to P passes nearby the origin, fulfilling occlusion. The distance computations confirm that no person should be more than 30 meters from the building’s center, which I need to keep in mind while selecting positions.**Positioning for optimal occlusion**

I’m determining four positions for points that will ensure their lines to the sniper occlude the building. To avoid overlaps, I need each center to be at least 0.5 apart. Ideally, I want to place them in the negative quadrant so that the lines cross near the origin. If P's y-coordinate is negative, it ensures the line could cross through the building range. So, I’ll select specific coordinates like (-6,-6) or (-12,-12) while maintaining the 30-meter radius constraint. However, I need to double-check that these placements actually achieve occlusion!**Confirming occlusion conditions**

I'm examining if placing P near the origin allows for occlusion. If P's x and y values are both negative and equal, they should lead to the line passing through the origin. I find that if k equals about 15 to 20, it creates the right conditions for occlusion since this ensures x and y both approach zero. Choosing points like (-6, -6) or (-21, -21) keeps them within a 30-meter radius while ensuring they don't overlap the building. It seems like the lines will successfully intersect the building interior, so that’s a win!**Finalizing structured coordinates**

I need to ensure that my chosen points for occlusion work correctly with the required parameters. The coordinates I'm thinking of are (-6, -6), (-12, -12), (-18, -18), and (-21, -21). I must check that none of these boxes overlap and all fit within the constraints set by the sniper’s position. 

I’ll output the final coordinates structured according to the specified JSON format, making sure it passes validation while providing a brief explanation if needed. So, I’m going to stick with the provided format and deliver the structured response.**Producing structured response**

The prompt indicates that I should follow the "structured_response" schema, but I believe the actual requirement can be fulfilled by providing the data in that format. So I'll use:

{"people":[{"xy":[-6,-6]},{"xy":[-12,-12]},{"xy":[-18,-18]},{"xy":[-21,-21]}]}

Additionally, I might implicitly note that the z-coordinate is 0. I'll ensure I present only the structured JSON format without any extra explanation. Time to finalize and deliver the structured response!
