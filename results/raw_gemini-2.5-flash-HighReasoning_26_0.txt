{'reasoning': 'A node is considered landlocked if its bounding box does not touch any of the six faces of the unit cube (x=0, x=1, y=0, y=1, z=0, z=1). The provided dimensions `[\'Z\', \'X\', \'Y\', \'Z\', \'X\', \'Y\', \'Z\', \'X\']` define the axis of subdivision for each step.1.  **Identify Split Dimensions and Indices**: We first identify the indices in a node\'s path string that correspond to splits along X, Y, and Z axes:    *   `Z_indices = [0, 3, 6]` (3 Z-splits)    *   `X_indices = [1, 4, 7]` (3 X-splits)    *   `Y_indices = [2, 5]` (2 Y-splits)2.  **Condition for Landlocked State per Dimension**:    *   Consider a specific dimension (e.g., X). A node\'s `x_min` will be 0 if all choices in its X-split path segment (e.g., `path[1]path[4]path[7]`) are \'0\'. Conversely, its `x_max` will be 1 if all choices are \'1\'.    *   For a node to *not touch* the `x=0` face (i.e., `x_min > 0`), its X-split path segment must contain at least one \'1\'.    *   For a node to *not touch* the `x=1` face (i.e., `x_max < 1`), its X-split path segment must contain at least one \'0\'.    *   Therefore, for a node to be landlocked along the X-dimension, its X-split path segment (`P_X`) must contain *both* \'0\' and \'1\'. The same logic applies independently to the Y and Z dimensions for their respective path segments (`P_Y` and `P_Z`).3.  **Overall Landlocked Condition**: A node is fully landlocked if and only if the split choices for its X, Y, and Z dimensions each satisfy the condition: they must contain both \'0\' and \'1\'.4.  **Algorithm**:    *   We iterate through all 2^8 = 256 possible leaf node paths (binary strings of length 8, from "00000000" to "11111111").    *   For each path, we extract the segments `P_X`, `P_Y`, and `P_Z` using the identified indices.    *   We then check if `(\'0\' in P_X and \'1\' in P_X)`, `(\'0\' in P_Y and \'1\' in P_Y)`, and `(\'0\' in P_Z and \'1\' in P_Z)`.    *   If all three conditions are true, the node is landlocked and is added to the result list.5.  **Expected Count (Verification)**:    *   For 3 splits (X and Z dimensions): There are 2^3 = 8 total possibilities. Only "000" (all \'0\'s) and "111" (all \'1\'s) do not contain both \'0\' and \'1\'. So, `8 - 2 = 6` valid combinations per dimension.    *   For 2 splits (Y dimension): There are 2^2 = 4 total possibilities. Only "00" and "11" do not contain both \'0\' and \'1\'. So, `4 - 2 = 2` valid combinations.    *   Since the choices are independent across dimensions, the total number of landlocked nodes is `6 * 6 * 2 = 72`.', 'nodes': ['00101110', '00111110', '01101110', '01111110', '10101110', '10111110', '11101110', '11111110', '00101101', '00111101', '01101101', '01111101', '10101101', '10111101', '11101101', '11111101', '00001010', '00011010', '01001010', '01011010', '10001010', '10011010', '11001010', '11011010', '00001001', '00011001', '01001001', '01011001', '10001001', '10011001', '11001001', '11011001', '00100110', '00110110', '01100110', '01110110', '10100110', '10110110', '11100110', '11110110', '00100101', '00110101', '01100101', '01110101', '10100101', '10110101', '11100101', '11110101', '00000010', '00010010', '01000010', '01010010', '10000010', '10010010', '11000010', '11010010', '00000001', '00010001', '01000001', '01010001', '10000001', '10010001', '11000001', '11010001', '00001110', '00011110', '01001110', '01011110', '10001110', '10011110', '11001110', '11011110']}
