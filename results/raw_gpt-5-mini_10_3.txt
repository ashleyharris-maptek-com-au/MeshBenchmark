{'reasoning': 'I can generate the requested 128×128 ASCII canvas, but I need one clarification so the projection and vertex placements match what you expect. You referred to "a regular pentagram of side length 5 units, centred at the origin, aligned so it\'s \'pointing\' positive y." Do you mean the five vertices are the outer points of a regular 5-point star (a pentagram), or did you mean the five vertices of a regular pentagon (i.e., the typical five-fold arrangement) where each adjacent vertex-to-vertex distance is 5 units? The geometry (positions of the cube bottoms) differs between those two interpretations. Which one do you want?', 'painting': ''}
