{'reasoning': 'I selected the outermost points (minimum/maximum x and y) that form the convex boundary and returned them in clockwise order. The hull follows the outer envelope: start at the lower-left-most point, go clockwise along the lower edge to the rightmost side, up the right boundary to the topmost-right area, then along the top to the left, and back down the left side to the start.', 'hull': [343, 382, 541, 26, 247, 28, 282, 505, 418]}
