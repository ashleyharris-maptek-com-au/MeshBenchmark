The shape starts narrow at the top, expands, then has a hollow section.\n\nLet me think about this geometrically:\n- The outer boundary seems to follow a diamond pattern centered around (3.5, 3.5)\n- There's a hollow region in the lower part\n\nFor a diamond centered at (3.5, 3.5), the condition would involve |x - 3.5| + |y - 3.5|. But I need to express this as a polynomial without absolute values.\n\nLooking more carefully, I can separate this into:\n1. An outer diamond boundary\n2. An inner excluded region in the bottom\n\nLet me try a different approach - this looks like it could be described by:\n- Being inside a larger diamond\n- Being outside a smaller region at the bottom\n\nUsing polynomial approximations:\n- Outer boundary: (x-3.5)^2 + (y-3.5)^2 < r^2 (circular) or diamond-like\n- Inner exclusion: some region in the lower middle\n\nAfter analysis, this pattern seems to match: the shape is positive where we want #, considering both the diamond expansion and the hollow bottom part.", 'function': 'def f(x, y):\n    return (y - 1) * (6 - y) * (x - 3.5)**2 - (y - 2) * (y - 3) * 12 + (y - 4) * (7 - x) * (x) - (y - 5) * ((x - 2)**2 + (x - 5)**2 - 8)'}
