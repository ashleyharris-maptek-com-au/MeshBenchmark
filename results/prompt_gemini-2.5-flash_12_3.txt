You have 60 1m lengths of pipe, and an square area of side length 10 to play with.

Lay the pipe out to form a closed loop, using all the pipe, and returning to the starting point.

You can not cross existing pipe, you can not re-use vertices, and you can not cross the boundary of the area. You do not need to 
stick to axis aligned paths.

Return the loop as a list of the pipe endpoints. Note that N pipes requires N+1 verticies to describe a path, but since the 
first and last vertices are the same, you only need to return N points.
