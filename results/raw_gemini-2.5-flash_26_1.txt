{'reasoning': 'The problem asks for nodes that touch node "000111" on an edge, but not a face. This means that an edge-touching node must share exactly one coordinate range identically with "000111", and have two coordinate ranges that are directly adjacent. All nodes are assumed to be at the same level of subdivision (length 6).\n\nFirst, we determine the sequence of dimensions for the subdivisions. The "Tree structure" provides this: 0:Z, 1:X, 2:Y, 3:Z, 4:X, 5:Y. Since the target node "000111" has 6 digits, we use the first 6 dimensions from this structure: D = [Z, X, Y, Z, X, Y].\n\nNext, we calculate the coordinate ranges for the target node P = "000111" using the dimension sequence D:\n- Initial cube: x=[0,1], y=[0,1], z=[0,1]\n- p1=\'0\' (Z): z becomes [0, 0.5]\n- p2=\'0\' (X): x becomes [0, 0.5]\n- p3=\'0\' (Y): y becomes [0, 0.5]\n- p4=\'1\' (Z): z becomes [0.25, 0.5] (split of current z [0,0.5])\n- p5=\'1\' (X): x becomes [0.25, 0.5] (split of current x [0,0.5])\n- p6=\'1\' (Y): y becomes [0.25, 0.5] (split of current y [0,0.5])\nSo, for P="000111": Px = [0.25, 0.5], Py = [0.25, 0.5], Pz = [0.25, 0.5].\n\nNow, we identify the \'adjacent\' ranges for each dimension. An adjacent range is one that shares a boundary with P\'s range at the same level of subdivision. We find this by systematically flipping bits in P\'s path that correspond to a specific dimension and checking the resulting range.\n\n1.  **Adjacent Z ranges for Pz=[0.25, 0.5]**: The Z splits occur at indices 0 and 3 (p1, p4). P\'s Z-path segment is "01".\n    -   Flip p4: Path "00". Z-range: [0, 0.25]. This is adjacent to Pz.\n    -   Flip p1 (keeping p4 to split the new range): Path "11". Z-range: [0.75, 1]. This is NOT adjacent to Pz.\n    Therefore, the only adjacent Z-path segment is "00" (for p1p4).\n\n2.  **Adjacent X ranges for Px=[0.25, 0.5]**: The X splits occur at indices 1 and 4 (p2, p5). P\'s X-path segment is "01".\n    -   Flip p5: Path "00". X-range: [0, 0.25]. This is adjacent to Px.\n    -   Flip p2: Path "11". X-range: [0.75, 1]. This is NOT adjacent to Px.\n    Therefore, the only adjacent X-path segment is "00" (for p2p5).\n\n3.  **Adjacent Y ranges for Py=[0.25, 0.5]**: The Y splits occur at indices 2 and 5 (p3, p6). P\'s Y-path segment is "01".\n    -   Flip p6: Path "00". Y-range: [0, 0.25]. This is adjacent to Py.\n    -   Flip p3: Path "11". Y-range: [0.75, 1]. This is NOT adjacent to Py.\n    Therefore, the only adjacent Y-path segment is "00" (for p3p6).\n\nTo find nodes touching on an edge (but not a face), we require one identical coordinate and two adjacent coordinates.\n\n**Case 1: Pz is identical, Px and Py are adjacent.**\n-   Pz\'s path segment \'01\' is for p1p4. So p1=\'0\', p4=\'1\'.\n-   Px\'s adjacent path segment \'00\' is for p2p5. So p2=\'0\', p5=\'0\'.\n-   Py\'s adjacent path segment \'00\' is for p3p6. So p3=\'0\', p6=\'0\'.\n-   Resulting node path: "000100".\n\n**Case 2: Px is identical, Pz and Py are adjacent.**\n-   Px\'s path segment \'01\' is for p2p5. So p2=\'0\', p5=\'1\'.\n-   Pz\'s adjacent path segment \'00\' is for p1p4. So p1=\'0\', p4=\'0\'.\n-   Py\'s adjacent path segment \'00\' is for p3p6. So p3=\'0\', p6=\'0\'.\n-   Resulting node path: "000010".\n\n**Case 3: Py is identical, Pz and Px are adjacent.**\n-   Py\'s path segment \'01\' is for p3p6. So p3=\'0\', p6=\'1\'.\n-   Pz\'s adjacent path segment \'00\' is for p1p4. So p1=\'0\', p4=\'0\'.\n-   Px\'s adjacent path segment \'00\' is for p2p5. So p2=\'0\', p5=\'0\'.\n-   Resulting node path: "000001".\n\nThese are the 3 nodes that touch "000111" on an edge but not a face.', 'nodes': ['000100', '000010', '000001']}
