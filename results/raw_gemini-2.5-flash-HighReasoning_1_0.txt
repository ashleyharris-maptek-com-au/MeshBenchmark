{'reasoning': "The 'H' shape is typically formed by two parallel vertical segments and one horizontal crossbar connecting them. We have 5 pipes, each 5 meters long. The problem states one pipe is fixed at (0,0) with a rotation of 0, meaning it's a horizontal pipe spanning from x=-2.5 to x=2.5. This pipe will serve as the crossbar of the 'H'.\n\nThe 'H' shape needs to be 10m high. Since each pipe is 5m long, each vertical leg of the 'H' must be formed by two pipes stacked end-to-end. This requires 2 pipes for the left leg and 2 pipes for the right leg, totaling 4 pipes. Combined with the central horizontal pipe, this uses all 5 pipes.\n\nTo achieve a 10m height with two 5m pipes, the vertical pipes must span from y=-5 to y=0 and from y=0 to y=5 respectively. The centers of these pipes would therefore be at y=-2.5 and y=2.5.\n\nThe fixed horizontal pipe spans from x=-2.5 to x=2.5. To form a flush 'H' shape where pipes touch at their ends without intersection, the vertical legs should align with the ends of the horizontal crossbar. This means the left vertical leg will be centered at x=-2.5, and the right vertical leg will be centered at x=2.5.\n\nConsidering the 'diameter' of the pipes and the rule 'pipes can not intersect each other, and should only touch at their ends': In 2D geometry problems of this type, 'intersection' typically refers to the main body of the pipes, and 'touching at ends' implies a standard flush joint where pipe centerlines meet at the specified coordinates. The diameter definition for the fixed pipe ('spans from -2.5,-0.05 to 2.5, 0.05') sets the extent of the pipe's material. For pipes to touch 'at their ends' in an 'H' configuration without material overlap, we interpret this as the central axes meeting and the pipe's physical bodies aligning to form the joint. Any other interpretation (e.g., leaving a gap or requiring complex T-joints that avoid any surface overlap) would either violate 'touch at ends' or result in a shape not typically considered an 'H' composed of these parts.\n\nThus, the positions for the 5 pipes are:\n1.  **Fixed pipe (crossbar):** Center at (0,0), horizontal (rotation 0).\n2.  **Left-top vertical pipe:** Connects at the left end of the crossbar (-2.5,0), extends upwards (y=0 to y=5). Center at (-2.5, 2.5), vertical (rotation 90).\n3.  **Left-bottom vertical pipe:** Connects at the left end of the crossbar (-2.5,0), extends downwards (y=-5 to y=0). Center at (-2.5, -2.5), vertical (rotation 90).\n4.  **Right-top vertical pipe:** Connects at the right end of the crossbar (2.5,0), extends upwards (y=0 to y=5). Center at (2.5, 2.5), vertical (rotation 90).\n5.  **Right-bottom vertical pipe:** Connects at the right end of the crossbar (2.5,0), extends downwards (y=-5 to y=0). Center at (2.5, -2.5), vertical (rotation 90).\n\nThis arrangement creates an 'H' shape that is 10m high (from y=-5 to y=5) and 5m wide (from x=-2.5 to x=2.5), with all pipes being 5m long and touching at their ends in the specified manner.", 'pipes': [{'xCentre': 0, 'yCentre': 0, 'rotationDegrees': 0}, {'xCentre': -2.5, 'yCentre': 2.5, 'rotationDegrees': 90}, {'xCentre': -2.5, 'yCentre': -2.5, 'rotationDegrees': 90}, {'xCentre': 2.5, 'yCentre': 2.5, 'rotationDegrees': 90}, {'xCentre': 2.5, 'yCentre': -2.5, 'rotationDegrees': 90}]}
