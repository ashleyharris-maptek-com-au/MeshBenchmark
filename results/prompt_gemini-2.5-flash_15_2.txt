You are playing Tetris(tm), and are cursed to only get the L-shaped tetrimino for all time.

The L shaped piece initially arrives in this orientation (with indent representing grid position):

###

It can be rotated in 90 degree increments clockwise, and moved left and right. The centre of rotation is the corner of the L.

Two units of movement to the right looks like this (noting indent):

Three units of movement to the right and a 90 degree clockwise rotation looks like this (noting indent):

2 units of movement to the right, and a 180 degree clockwise rotation looks like this (noting indent):

Blocks spawn at position 0,0, the top left of the grid. The grid is 20 cells wide and 30 cells high.

When a row is filled, it is removed from the grid, and all blocks above it are shifted down by one row.

Position blocks by moving them left and right, and rotating them in clockwise 90 degree increments for as long as possible. 
When you get bored, run out of token limits, mistakenly truncate your output, or make too many mistakes, 
the game will end and your score will be tallied. You solution must remove at least 20 rows to pass.
