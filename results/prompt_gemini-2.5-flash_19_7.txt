Here is the points and faces of a regular tetrahedron with all sides equal 1, resting on the Z=0 plane and with an edge along the X=0 plane:

polyhedron(
    points = [
        [0, 0, 0],                               // 0
        [1, 0, 0],                               // 1
        [0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0],                     // 2
        [0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(2/3)]              // 3 (apex)
    ],
    faces = [
        [0, 2, 1],   // base (oriented outward)
        [0, 1, 3],
        [1, 2, 3],
        [2, 0, 3]
    ],
    convexity = 4
);

We define a 7-part rigid transform of (x,y,z,q0,q1,q2,q3), where q0,q1,q2,q3 is a normalised quaternion, and x, y, z are the translation.
Rotation is defined around the 0,0,0 point (Which is NOT THE CENTRE), and is performed before translation.

We create a scene with multiple tetrahedra, each with a different transform. Now we can pack them in as tightly as possible
in order to create a 3D shape, trying to maximize packing density and recreate the target shape.

Return the transform array of tetrahedra in order to create a:
Tetrahedron of side length 10, with vertices at 0,0,0 and 10,0,0.
