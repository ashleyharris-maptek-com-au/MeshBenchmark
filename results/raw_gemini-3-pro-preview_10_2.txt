{'reasoning': 'The scene consists of 5 cubes of size 1x1x1 arranged in a pentagram pattern of side length 5 centered at the origin. The camera is positioned at the North-East, looking down at a 45-degree angle using an orthographic projection. \n\n1.  **Coordinate System**: We define World coordinates where +X is East, +Y is North, and +Z is Up. The camera view vector is towards (-1, -1, -sqrt(2)) to satisfy the 45-degree look-down angle (elevation) and 45-degree azimuth (NE). \n2.  **Projection**: We map World (x,y,z) to Canvas (u,v). The horizontal axis u corresponds to the cross product of the view direction and the world up vector, resulting in `u = (y - x) * sin(45)`. The vertical axis v corresponds to the projected Z axis, roughly `v = z * sin(45) - (x + y) * sin(45) * cos(45)` adjusted for the specific look-down angle. Using unit vectors: `u = 0.7071(y - x)` and `v = 0.7071z - 0.5(x + y)`.\n3.  **Cube Positions**: The pentagram vertices (side length 5, pointing +Y) lie on a circle of radius R ≈ 2.63. The coordinates are calculated for angles 90°, 162°, 234°, 306°, and 18°. The cubes are centered at these (x,y) with z ranging from 0 to 1.\n4.  **Rasterization**: We compute the bounding box of the projected cubes in (u,v) space and map the 64x64 canvas to this range. For each pixel, we cast a ray to determine intersection with the 3 visible faces of each cube (Top, North, East). \n    - Top Face (+Z): mapped to `#`\n    - East Face (+X): mapped to `"`\n    - North Face (+Y): mapped to `\'`\n    We use a depth check (`depth = x + y + sqrt(2)z`) to handle occlusion.', 'painting': '                                                                \n                                                                \n                                            ##                  \n                                           #\'"\'                 \n                                           \'"\'"                 \n                                           \'"\'"                 \n                                           \'"\'"                 \n                                           \'"\'"                 \n                                            "\'                  \n                                                                \n                       ##                                       \n                      #\'"\'                                      \n                      \'"\'"                                      \n                      \'"\'"                  ##                  \n                      \'"\'"                 #\'"\'                 \n                      \'"\'"                 \'"\'"                 \n                       "\'                  \'"\'"                 \n                                           \'"\'"                 \n                                           \'"\'"                 \n                                            "\'                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n            ##                                                  \n           #\'"\'                                                 \n           \'"\'"                                                 \n           \'"\'"                                                 \n           \'"\'"                                                 \n           \'"\'"                                                 \n            "\'                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                      ##        \n                                                     #\'"\'       \n                                                     \'"\'"       \n                                                     \'"\'"       \n                                                     \'"\'"       \n                                                     \'"\'"       \n                                                      "\'        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                       ##                                       \n                      #\'"\'                                      \n                      \'"\'"                                      \n                      \'"\'"                                      \n                      \'"\'"                                      \n                      \'"\'"                                      \n                       "\'                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                '}
