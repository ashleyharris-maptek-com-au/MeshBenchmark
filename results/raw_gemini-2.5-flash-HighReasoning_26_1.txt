{'reasoning': 'The task is to find all nodes that touch the target node "000111" on an edge, but not on a face. This implies finding neighbors of the same size (same depth in the tree) that share a common edge.\n\n1.  **Understand the Subdivision and Target Node Ranges**: The tree structure defines the dimension to be split at each depth: 0: Z, 1: X, 2: Y, 3: Z, 4: X, 5: Y, etc. The target node "000111" has a path length of 6, so the splits are Z, X, Y, Z, X, Y.\n    -   We trace the coordinate ranges for "000111":\n        -   Initial: X=[0,1], Y=[0,1], Z=[0,1]\n        -   \'0\' (Z split): Z=[0, 0.5]\n        -   \'0\' (X split): X=[0, 0.5]\n        -   \'0\' (Y split): Y=[0, 0.5]\n        -   \'1\' (Z split): Z=[0.25, 0.5] (upper half of [0, 0.5])\n        -   \'1\' (X split): X=[0.25, 0.5] (upper half of [0, 0.5])\n        -   \'1\' (Y split): Y=[0.25, 0.5] (upper half of [0, 0.5])\n    -   So, node "000111" occupies the coordinate space: X=[0.25, 0.5], Y=[0.25, 0.5], Z=[0.25, 0.5].\n\n2.  **Define Edge Neighbors (but not Face Neighbors)**:\n    -   An edge neighbor of a hyper-rectangular node shares exactly one common dimension range and is adjacent in the other two dimensions. For example, if node N is X_range, Y_range, Z_range, an edge neighbor might be X_adjacent_range, Y_adjacent_range, Z_range.\n    -   There are 3 choices for the shared dimension (X, Y, or Z).\n    -   For each of the two adjacent dimensions, there are two possible directions (lower or upper range).\n    -   This leads to `3 (fixed dim) * 2 (dir for 1st adj dim) * 2 (dir for 2nd adj dim) = 12` potential edge neighbors.\n\n3.  **Determine Adjacent Ranges for Each Dimension**:\n    -   Target ranges for "000111": `N_X_range = [0.25, 0.5]`, `N_Y_range = [0.25, 0.5]`, `N_Z_range = [0.25, 0.5]`.\n    -   Adjacent ranges (lower/upper half of the *parent* range for that subdivision level):\n        -   `X_lower = [0, 0.25]`, `X_upper = [0.5, 0.75]`\n        -   `Y_lower = [0, 0.25]`, `Y_upper = [0.5, 0.75]`\n        -   `Z_lower = [0, 0.25]`, `Z_upper = [0.5, 0.75]`\n\n4.  **Generate Neighbor Paths**: For each of the 12 combinations of target coordinate ranges (e.g., `X_lower`, `Y_lower`, `N_Z_range`), we construct the corresponding 6-character node path. This is done by simulating the subdivision process: at each step, based on the dimension being split and the target range for that dimension, we determine whether to choose \'0\' (lower half) or \'1\' (upper half).\n\n    The dimensions for splits (depth 0-5) are: `D_0=Z, D_1=X, D_2=Y, D_3=Z, D_4=X, D_5=Y`.\n\n    -   **Fixed Z (X, Y change)**:\n        -   (X_lower, Y_lower, N_Z_range): X=[0,0.25], Y=[0,0.25], Z=[0.25,0.5] -> "000100"\n        -   (X_lower, Y_upper, N_Z_range): X=[0,0.25], Y=[0.5,0.75], Z=[0.25,0.5] -> "001100"\n        -   (X_upper, Y_lower, N_Z_range): X=[0.5,0.75], Y=[0,0.25], Z=[0.25,0.5] -> "010100"\n        -   (X_upper, Y_upper, N_Z_range): X=[0.5,0.75], Y=[0.5,0.75], Z=[0.25,0.5] -> "011100"\n\n    -   **Fixed Y (X, Z change)**:\n        -   (X_lower, N_Y_range, Z_lower): X=[0,0.25], Y=[0.25,0.5], Z=[0,0.25] -> "000001"\n        -   (X_lower, N_Y_range, Z_upper): X=[0,0.25], Y=[0.25,0.5], Z=[0.5,0.75] -> "100001"\n        -   (X_upper, N_Y_range, Z_lower): X=[0.5,0.75], Y=[0.25,0.5], Z=[0,0.25] -> "010001"\n        -   (X_upper, N_Y_range, Z_upper): X=[0.5,0.75], Y=[0.25,0.5], Z=[0.5,0.75] -> "110001"\n\n    -   **Fixed X (Y, Z change)**:\n        -   (N_X_range, Y_lower, Z_lower): X=[0.25,0.5], Y=[0,0.25], Z=[0,0.25] -> "000010"\n        -   (N_X_range, Y_lower, Z_upper): X=[0.25,0.5], Y=[0,0.25], Z=[0.5,0.75] -> "100010"\n        -   (N_X_range, Y_upper, Z_lower): X=[0.25,0.5], Y=[0.5,0.75], Z=[0,0.25] -> "001010"\n        -   (N_X_range, Y_upper, Z_upper): X=[0.25,0.5], Y=[0.5,0.75], Z=[0.5,0.75] -> "101010"', 'nodes': ['000100', '001100', '010100', '011100', '000001', '100001', '010001', '110001', '000010', '100010', '001010', '101010']}
