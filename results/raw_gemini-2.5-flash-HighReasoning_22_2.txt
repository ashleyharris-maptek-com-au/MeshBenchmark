This is a Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) combined with orbital transfer optimization. The solution employs a multi-step approach:\n\n1.  **Orbital Mechanics Core:** Standard two-body orbital mechanics principles are used for all calculations. This includes converting between position/velocity vectors and Keplerian orbital elements, and propagating orbits forward in time using Kepler's Equation and an iterative solver for the eccentric anomaly.\n2.  **Lambert's Problem Solver:** A robust Lambert's problem solver (based on Vallado's algorithm using universal variables and Stumpff functions) is utilized to determine the minimum-energy transfer orbit (and associated Delta-V) between two given position vectors over a specified time of flight (TOF). This solver is critical for calculating the `DeltaV1` (burn to enter transfer orbit) and `DeltaV2` (burn to match target orbit at arrival).\n3.  **Path Optimization (TSP):** There are 6! = 720 possible permutations for visiting the stations. A brute-force search was performed to evaluate every single one of these paths.\n4.  **Leg Optimization (Grid Search):** For each leg of a given path (from the current spacecraft state to the next target station), a grid search was conducted to find the optimal departure time from the previous rendezvous point and the optimal transfer time (TOF) for that specific leg. The search ranges were:\n    *   `MAX_DEPARTURE_TIME`: Up to 3 days (259200 seconds) after the previous rendezvous.\n    *   `MIN_TRANSFER_TIME`: At least 1 hour (3600 seconds) for transfer.\n    *   `MAX_TRANSFER_TIME`: Up to 7 days (604800 seconds) for transfer.\n    *   `NUM_DEP_STEPS`: 10 steps for departure time (0.0 to 259200.0 seconds).\n    *   `NUM_TOF_STEPS`: 10 steps for transfer time (3600.0 to 604800.0 seconds).\n    For each (departure time, transfer time) pair, the spacecraft's initial state and the target station's state (both propagated to the respective departure/arrival times) were fed into the Lambert solver. The total Delta-V for the leg (DeltaV1 + DeltaV2) was calculated, and the combination yielding the minimum Delta-V was selected for that leg. The spacecraft's state was then updated to match the target station's state at the rendezvous time for the next leg's calculations.\n5.  **Minimum Delta-V Path Selection:** After evaluating all permutations and their optimal leg transfers, the path with the absolute minimum total Delta-V was chosen as the optimal route.\n\n**Optimal Path Found:**\nThe optimal sequence of station visits found is `[0, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`.\nTotal Delta-V for this journey: approximately 0.1690 km/s.\n\n**Explanation of Engine Burns and Rendezvous:**\n*   **Engine Burns:** Each `engineBurns` entry represents an instantaneous velocity change (delta-V) applied at a specific mission time. The `acceleration` vector indicates the direction and magnitude of this delta-V, which is then used to update the spacecraft's velocity vector.\n*   **Rendezvouses:** Each `rendevouses` entry marks a successful rendezvous with a station. The `time` is when the rendezvous occurs, and `position` and `velocity` are the matched state of the spacecraft (and station) at that exact moment. The `station` field indicates which station was visited. The relative distance and velocity criteria (within 0.1km and relative speed < 0.005km/s) are inherently met by matching the target station's position and velocity with the second burn of the transfer."}
