{'reasoning': "The shape resembles a skewed ellipse or a rotated diamond. A general quadratic polynomial of the form Ax^2 + By^2 + Cxy + Dx + Ey + F is suitable for representing such shapes as an implicit curve f(x,y) = 0, where points inside the shape satisfy f(x,y) > 0 and points outside satisfy f(x,y) <= 0.\n\n1.  **Choose a center of approximation:** I picked (x_c, y_c) = (11, 13) as a reference point close to the visual center of the blob. Let dx = x - x_c and dy = y - y_c.\n2.  **Define the general quadratic form:** f(dx, dy) = A*dx^2 + B*dy^2 + C*dx*dy + D*dx + E*dy + F.\n3.  **Use boundary conditions to find coefficients:**\n    *   **Vertical Profile (along x=11, so dx=0):** Points (11,9) and (11,18) are '#' (inside), while (11,8) and (11,19) are '.' (outside). This section of the function is B*dy^2 + E*dy + F. Using these four points to set approximate conditions:\n        *   f(0, -4) > 0 (for (11,9))\n        *   f(0, 5) > 0 (for (11,18))\n        *   f(0, -5) <= 0 (for (11,8))\n        *   f(0, 6) <= 0 (for (11,19))\n        From this, I derived B = -4, E = 1, and set F = 100 (a positive constant to ensure the center is positive and provide a margin).\n        Intermediate function: f(dx, dy) = A*dx^2 - 4*dy^2 + C*dx*dy + D*dx + dy + 100.\n    *   **Horizontal/Skewed Profile:** The shape is wider at the bottom right and narrower at the top left. This suggests a non-zero C*dx*dy term and possibly a D*dx term.\n        I chose four additional critical points on the left and right boundaries:\n        *   (5,9) -> dx=-6, dy=-4 (inside)\n        *   (18,15) -> dx=7, dy=2 (inside)\n        *   (4,9) -> dx=-7, dy=-4 (outside)\n        *   (19,15) -> dx=8, dy=2 (outside)\n        Assuming D=0 for simplicity, I tested values for A and C. For A=-2, I found that C=2 satisfies all conditions: \n        *   `A = -2`\n        *   `B = -4`\n        *   `C = 2`\n        *   `D = 0`\n        *   `E = 1`\n        *   `F = 100`\n4.  **Substitute back and expand:**\n    `f(x,y) = -2(x-11)^2 - 4(y-13)^2 + 2(x-11)(y-13) + (y-13) + 100`\n    Expanding this polynomial:\n    `= -2(x^2 - 22x + 121) - 4(y^2 - 26y + 169) + 2(xy - 13x - 11y + 143) + y - 13 + 100`\n    `= -2x^2 + 44x - 242 - 4y^2 + 104y - 676 + 2xy - 26x - 22y + 286 + y - 13 + 100`\n    `= -2x^2 - 4y^2 + 2xy + (44 - 26)x + (104 - 22 + 1)y + (-242 - 676 + 286 - 13 + 100)`\n    `= -2x^2 - 4y^2 + 2xy + 18x + 83y - 545`\n5.  **Verification:** The resulting polynomial was tested against several points inside and outside the grid, confirming it accurately reproduces the desired shape according to the `f(x,y) > 0` condition for '#' and `f(x,y) <= 0` for '.'.", 'function': 'def f(x, y):\n    return -2*x**2 - 4*y**2 + 2*x*y + 18*x + 83*y - 545'}
