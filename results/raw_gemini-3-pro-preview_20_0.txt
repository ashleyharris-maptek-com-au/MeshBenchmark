{'reasoningAndDiscussion': "The solution implements a 'point-in-polygon' ray-casting algorithm to define the implicit function f(x,y). \n\n1.  **Coordinate System**: The input (x, y) is normalized to [0, 1]. I mapped the Mercator projection of Australia to a 100x100 integer grid. The Y-axis is inverted relative to standard Mercator (North=0, South=1) as per the prompt's boundary requirements (Cape York at y=0, SE Cape at y=1).\n2.  **Data**: I manually extracted key coordinates for the Australian mainland and Tasmania, applying the Mercator projection and normalizing them to the bounding box. \n    *   Mainland vertices (approx 17 points) capture the shape including Cape York, Cape Byron, Steep Point, and the major bays.\n    *   Tasmania vertices (4 points) form a diamond shape south of the mainland.\n    *   Coordinates are stored as a flattened list of integers to save space.\n3.  **Algorithm**: The function iterates through the edges of both polygons. For each edge, it checks if a ray cast horizontally from (x, y) intersects the edge. The variable `c` tracks the parity of intersections (inside/outside). Since the polygons are disjoint, a simple XOR toggle works.\n4.  **Return Value**: The function returns `1` if inside (odd intersections) and `-1` if outside, satisfying the f(x,y) > 0 requirement.\n5.  **Constraints**: The code is well under 1024 bytes, uses no internal imports, and fits the strict bounding box lines (y=0, y=1, x=0, x=1) using the pre-calculated extrema points.", 'minifiedCode': 'def f(x,y):\n X,Y=x*100,y*100;c=0\n for P in[[73,0,84,23,100,50,91,77,82,82,61,69,44,58,22,66,5,67,0,42,2,30,14,25,22,20,44,5,59,4,64,17,71,5],[78,88,86,88,83,100,80,97]]:\n  n=len(P)\n  for i in range(0,n,2):\n   x1,y1=P[i],P[i+1];x2,y2=P[(i+2)%n],P[(i+3)%n]\n   if(y1>Y)!=(y2>Y):\n    if X<(x2-x1)*(Y-y1)/(y2-y1)+x1:c^=1\n return c*2-1'}
