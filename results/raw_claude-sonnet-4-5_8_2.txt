{'reasoning': "Looking at the grid, I need to identify the shape. The '#' characters form a shape that appears to be roughly circular or elliptical, centered around coordinates approximately (9, 13). Let me trace the boundary:\n\n- The shape starts around y=9 and extends to about y=18\n- Horizontally, it spans from roughly x=5 to x=15 at its widest\n- The center appears to be around (9, 13)\n\nThis looks like it could be represented by a circle or ellipse equation. For a circle centered at (h, k) with radius r:\n(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 < r^2\n\nLet me estimate:\n- Center: approximately (9, 13)\n- The shape extends about 5-6 units in x direction from center\n- The shape extends about 5-6 units in y direction from center\n\nTesting with a circle equation: (x - 9)^2 + (y - 13)^2 - r^2\nFor f(x,y) > 0 to give '#', I need: r^2 - (x - 9)^2 - (y - 13)^2 > 0\n\nLooking at the widest point around y=13, it goes from about x=4 to x=15, so radius is about 5.5 in x.\nLooking at y direction from center at y=13, it goes from about y=9 to y=18, so about 5 units up and down.\n\nLet me try r^2 = 36 (radius 6).\n\nActually, re-examining more carefully, the shape looks slightly wider than tall, suggesting an ellipse. Let me try:\n36 - (x - 9)^2 - (y - 13)^2", 'function': 'def f(x, y):\n    return 36 - (x - 9)**2 - (y - 13)**2'}
