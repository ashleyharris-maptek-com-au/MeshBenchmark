{'reasoning': 'Goal: trap rainfall in a central basin so that after the rain stops there is a lake with depth >= 6 voxels. The world is 56x56x8 with dirt occupying z=0..2 and air above. Rainfall starts at the top center and water can move downward if there’s air, or flood-fill laterally at the level below a water voxel, with boundary leakage at the map edge. The simplest robust solution is to carve a deep central basin and surround it with a sealed dirt wall that spans the full height of the world (or at least high enough to prevent lateral leakage during rainfall). By placing a sealed ring around a central pit whose floor lies on the existing ground, rainfall will accumulate inside the basin and cannot escape to the map edges. If the basin interior starts as air down to z=0 and is surrounded by dirt walls from z=3 to z=7, the water will fill the interior up to the rim (z=7) and create a lake with depth well above 6 voxels once rainfall ends. Implementation outline:\n\n1) Create a central circular basin (interior) by clearing all voxels within a radius of about 11 voxels around the world center (x=28, y=28) to air for all z (0 through 7). This yields a hollow interior space spanning the full height of the map.\n2) Build a continuous circular dirt wall around that interior: for all voxels with (dx, dy) such that 11^2 < dx^2+dy^2 <= 12^2 (a ring of thickness 1 voxel), set to dirt for z in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. This wall seals the interior against lateral leakage at the upper levels.\n3) Optional refinement for extra security: add a second outer wall around the first (e.g., 13^2 >= dx^2+dy^2 > 14^2) at the same z-range to block any potential seepage around the ring during heavy rainfall, ensuring the inner basin remains flooded.\n4) After these edits, rainfall will fill the interior space. Since the interior floor is at or below the surrounding ring (the interior is carved down to z=0), the resulting water column inside the basin will reach high depth. With the ceiling at z=7, the maximum possible interior water depth exceeds 6 voxels, satisfying the requirement.\n5) The setup relies on a closed wall at all relevant z to prevent water from escaping to the map edges. Ensure there are no gaps in the ring at z=3..7; with a solid circle of dirt, water cannot bypass the wall via the flood-fill behavior described.\n\nIf you want a more conservative design, you can place the ring with a slightly larger outer radius and/or extend the wall thickness to 2 voxels (i.e., dirt rings at radii 11–12 and 13–14) to guarantee containment even under perturbations or irregular rainfall patterns. The key is a sealed boundary surrounding an interior pit that is open to air only inside the ring, so rainfall can collect as a lake but not escape to the map edge.', 'voxels': []}
