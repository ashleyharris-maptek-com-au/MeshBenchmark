{'reasoning': "The shape is an inverted 'A' or a triangle with a hole, which can be decomposed into two intersecting strips forming an upside-down L-shape (in a transformed coordinate system). Let u = x + y - 5 and v = y - x + 2. The solid regions roughly correspond to u in [0, 2] (left leg) and v in [0, 2] (right leg). The 'hole' is where u >= 3 and v >= 3. The background also includes u < 0 and v < 0. \n\nWe construct a polynomial P(t) = t*(t-1)*(t-2) which is 0 for t in {0, 1, 2}. The term 1 - P(u)^2 * P(v)^2 acts as a logical OR for the condition 'u in [0,2] or v in [0,2]', evaluating to 1 inside the shape and a large negative number in the hole (where both P(u) and P(v) are non-zero). \n\nTo handle the boundaries u < 0 and v < 0 (which would otherwise result in 'solid' ghost arms), we multiply by (u+1)*(v+1). This term is zero or negative for the external boundaries u=-1 or v=-1, ensuring f(x,y) <= 0 for the background.", 'function': 'def f(x, y): return (x+y-4)*(y-x+3)*(1-((x+y-5)*(x+y-6)*(x+y-7))**2*((y-x+2)*(y-x+1)*(y-x))**2)'}
