{'reasoning': "To find the points a rubber band would touch when stretched around a scene of 2D points, we need to compute the convex hull of the given points. The Monotone Chain algorithm (also known as Andrew's algorithm) is an efficient method to achieve this. The steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Represent points**: Each point is stored as a tuple `(x, y, original_index)`.\n2.  **Sort points**: All points are sorted lexicographically, first by x-coordinate, then by y-coordinate. This sorted list is denoted as `P`.\n3.  **Build Upper Hull**: Iterate through the sorted points `P` from left to right. Maintain an `upper_hull` list. For each point `p`, while the `upper_hull` has at least two points and the path formed by the last two points in `upper_hull` and `p` constitutes a non-left turn (i.e., a right turn or collinear points, determined by a cross product less than or equal to zero), pop the last point from `upper_hull`. Then, add `p` to `upper_hull`.\n4.  **Build Lower Hull**: Iterate through the sorted points `P` from right to left (i.e., in reverse order). Maintain a `lower_hull` list. For each point `p`, while the `lower_hull` has at least two points and the path formed by the last two points in `lower_hull` and `p` constitutes a non-left turn (i.e., a right turn or collinear points, determined by a cross product less than or equal to zero), pop the last point from `lower_hull`. Then, add `p` to `lower_hull`.\n5.  **Combine Hulls**: The complete convex hull is formed by concatenating the `upper_hull` and the `lower_hull`. To avoid duplicating the starting and ending points (which are shared between the upper and lower hulls), the first and last points of the `lower_hull` are usually excluded from the concatenation. The final list of points is then sorted by their original indices.\n\n**Cross Product Calculation**: For three points `o`, `a`, and `b`, the cross product `(a.x - o.x) * (b.y - o.y) - (a.y - o.y) * (b.x - o.x)` determines the turn direction:\n    *   `> 0`: Counter-clockwise (left turn)\n    *   `< 0`: Clockwise (right turn)\n    *   `= 0`: Collinear\n\nFollowing these steps, the points forming the convex hull (the rubber band) are:\n\n*   `8: (4, 3)` (This is the leftmost point, and among points with the same minimum x-coordinate, it has the minimum y-coordinate. It becomes the starting point of the lower hull and the overall hull.)\n*   `17: (35, 0)` (Lowest point)\n*   `55: (99, 7)` (Rightmost point, and among points with the same maximum x-coordinate, it has the minimum y-coordinate. It becomes the ending point of the lower hull and the overall hull.)\n*   `22: (97, 43)` (Highest Y for X=97. If 55 is the rightmost, the upper hull will approach it from higher points and then wrap down to it. This point is part of the upper hull, representing a significant turn just before the rightmost point.)\n*   `13: (91, 83)` (Another point on the upper right part of the hull)\n*   `5: (86, 94)` (Upper right part of the hull)\n*   `54: (41, 98)` (Highest Y point)\n*   `36: (29, 98)` (Another highest Y point. Since (41,98) is also on the hull, and they have the same Y, and (29,98) has smaller X, this means (29,98) is to the 'left' of (41,98) along the top edge)\n*   `1: (3, 94)` (Leftmost point, and among points with the same minimum x-coordinate, it has the maximum y-coordinate. It becomes the starting point of the upper hull and the overall hull.)\n\nThese points, when ordered in a counter-clockwise direction, form the convex hull:\n8, 17, 55, 22, 13, 5, 54, 36, 1.\n\nLet's verify the point indices and coordinates:\n8: (4, 3)\n17: (35, 0)\n55: (99, 7)\n22: (97, 43)\n13: (91, 83)\n5: (86, 94)\n54: (41, 98)\n36: (29, 98)\n1: (3, 94)", 'pointSequence': [8, 17, 55, 22, 13, 5, 54, 36, 1]}
