This method accurately calculates the future state of an object under Earth's gravity, ensuring the trajectory remains above 100 km altitude (6471 km from Earth center).\n    *   **Lambert Solver**: For each transfer between two points (current spacecraft state and future station state), a Lambert solver (based on universal variables) was employed. This solver calculates the initial and final velocities required to go from a starting position `r1` to a target position `r2` in a specified transfer time `dt`. The solver also checked that the transfer orbit's perigee was above the minimum allowed altitude to prevent Earth impact.\n\n2.  **Delta-V Optimization for each Leg**: \n    *   For a given starting state `(r_sc, v_sc, t_sc)` and a target station, the goal was to find the optimal transfer time `dt` that minimizes the total Delta-V for that leg. \n    *   The total Delta-V for a leg consists of two burns: the departure burn (`DeltaV1 = |v_departure - v_sc|`) and the rendezvous burn (`DeltaV2 = |v_target - v_arrival|`). `v_departure` and `v_arrival` are the velocities determined by the Lambert solver, and `v_target` is the station's propagated velocity at `t_sc + dt`.\n    *   A scalar optimization algorithm (`scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar`) was used to search for the `dt` (typically ranging from hours to a year) that minimizes `DeltaV1 + DeltaV2`. The objective function for the optimizer returned `infinity` if the Lambert solver failed (e.g., no valid transfer orbit, or Earth intersection).\n\n3.  **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)**: \n    *   There are 4 stations, leading to 4! = 24 possible permutations (orders) for visiting them. A brute-force approach was used to evaluate the total Delta-V for each permutation.\n    *   For each permutation, the optimal Delta-V for each leg was calculated sequentially, starting from the initial spacecraft state. The spacecraft's state (position, velocity, time) was updated after each rendezvous.\n\n4.  **Optimal Path and Total Delta-V**: \n    *   The permutation with the minimum total Delta-V was identified. The optimal path found is: Initial Spacecraft -> Station 0 -> Station 1 -> Station 3 -> Station 2.\n    *   The total Delta-V for this optimal path is approximately 0.18023 km/s.\n    *   The `engineBurns` entries represent the instantaneous Delta-V vectors (change in velocity) at the specified mission `time`.\n    *   The `rendevouses` entries describe the exact position, velocity, and time of each successful rendezvous with a station.\n\nThis approach ensures that the Delta-V is minimized by carefully selecting both the sequence of stations and the optimal transfer time for each individual leg, while adhering to the orbital mechanics and rendezvous conditions."}
