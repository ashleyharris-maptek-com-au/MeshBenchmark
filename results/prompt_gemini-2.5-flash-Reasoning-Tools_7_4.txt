Here is a heightmap platform maze, in which A is located at height 5, and B is located at height 0. 
The maze represents a 3D space where movement is constrained by height differences. 
Characters can only move to adjacent cells if the height difference is at most 1, or jump over gaps.

A555
2B20
3015
4555

The character can move:
- 1 cell horizontally or vertically, so long as the height is within 1 unit.
- Can jump 2 cells horizontally or vertically, so long as:
  - source and destination heights are the same
  - the height of the cell between the source and destination is lower than the source height (jump over gaps, not through walls!)

In this case, the character:
- starts at A, which is at level 5
- walks flat for a bit, 
- jumps over a gap of height 0 to another level 5 block.
- walks flat for a bit
- descends until level 2, then jumps over B to level 2,
- and then continues down to level 0, reaching B.

The maze must use only 0-9, A & B to represent height, and must only have one solution.
A & B must appear in the grid once each.
The path must visit at least 20% of all cells.
No single elevation can occupy more than 20% of the grid.
Create a maze of size 25x25 that has A at level 5 and B at level 5, and at least 10 jumps.
Your output must be ONLY the maze's heightmap, nothing else.
Your output must be 25 rows long, and every row must be 25 characters long.
The maze must be your only output - Extra text above or below the maze itself corrupt your work.
