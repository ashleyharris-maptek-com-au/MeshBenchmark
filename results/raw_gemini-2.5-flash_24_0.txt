{'reasoning': "To find the points that a rubber band touches when stretched around the scene, we need to compute the convex hull of the given set of points. The Monotone Chain algorithm (a variation of Graham Scan) is used for this purpose. The steps are as follows: 1. Represent each point with its ID and coordinates (x, y). 2. Sort all points primarily by their x-coordinate, and secondarily by their y-coordinate to handle ties. Let this sorted list be P. 3. Build the 'lower hull' (the bottom boundary of the convex hull). Initialize an empty stack, `lower_hull`. Iterate through the points in P. For each point `p`, while the stack has at least two points and the orientation formed by the last two points on the stack and `p` is a non-left turn (i.e., a right turn or collinear), pop the last point from the stack. Then, push `p` onto the stack. The cross product `(p2.x - p1.x) * (p3.y - p1.y) - (p2.y - p1.y) * (p3.x - p1.x)` is used to determine orientation: a value <= 0 indicates a non-left turn. 4. Build the 'upper hull' (the top boundary of the convex hull). Initialize an empty stack, `upper_hull`. Iterate through the points in P in reverse order. For each point `p`, while the stack has at least two points and the orientation formed by the last two points on the stack and `p` is a non-left turn (right turn or collinear), pop the last point from the stack. Then, push `p` onto the stack. 5. Combine the lower and upper hulls. The first point of the lower hull and the last point of the upper hull are typically the same (the leftmost point), and the last point of the lower hull and the first point of the upper hull are typically the same (the rightmost point). To form a continuous counter-clockwise sequence of unique points, concatenate the `lower_hull` (excluding its last point) with the `upper_hull` (excluding its first and last points).  The resulting sequence of point IDs constitutes the convex hull.  Sorted Points (ID: (x, y)): [1:(3,94), 8:(4,3), 9:(11,27), 3:(28,17), 10:(29,64), 2:(35,31), 15:(53,28), 6:(69,11), 12:(71,25), 7:(75,54), 11:(77,3), 0:(81,14), 5:(86,94), 14:(89,69), 13:(91,83), 4:(94,13)]. Lower Hull (left-to-right): [1, 8, 11, 4]. Upper Hull (right-to-left): [4, 13, 5, 1]. Combining them (lower_hull[:-1] + upper_hull[1:-1]) yields [1, 8, 11, 13, 5].", 'pointSequence': [1, 8, 11, 4, 13, 5]}
