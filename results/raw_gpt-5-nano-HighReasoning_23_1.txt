{'reasoning': 'To create three unconnected water bodies each at least 2x2, carve three small pits in the dirt that will act as sealed basins for rainwater. Keeping the pits separated by surrounding dirt walls prevents the water from merging into a single pool. By placing three 2x2 air pockets at a shallow depth (z=3) and surrounding them with dirt walls, rainfall entering from the top center will eventually fill each pocket independently, yielding three separate water bodies after rain ends. The holes are placed away from one another to guarantee unconnected pools: near the top-left quadrant, top-right quadrant, and the bottom-mid area. This plan relies on creating air pockets (dirt removed) at z=3 and leaving surrounding voxels as dirt to form enclosing walls. If simulation shows any unexpected connectivity, slightly adjust walls around the pits to maintain separation while preserving 2x2 basins.', 'voxels': [{'xyz': [4, 4, 3], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [4, 5, 3], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [5, 4, 3], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [5, 5, 3], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [18, 4, 3], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [18, 5, 3], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [19, 4, 3], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [19, 5, 3], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [12, 19, 3], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [12, 20, 3], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [13, 19, 3], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [13, 20, 3], 'material': 'Air'}]}
