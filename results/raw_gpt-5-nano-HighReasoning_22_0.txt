{'reasoning': 'Plan outline: The mission starts in a roughly 1350 km altitude Low Earth Orbit (r ≈ 7.7e3 km). The two stations orbit at roughly 600 km altitude (r ≈ 6.97e3 km) with similar orbital speeds. The fuel-optimal approach in this simplified two-body context is to perform impulsive transfers that move the spacecraft from its initial orbit to the station orbits in a sequence that minimizes total delta-V, typically via Hohmann-like legs and phasing to rendezvous when the station crosses the interception point. Given the near-circular, near-coplanar character of these example orbits, the best practical plan is to visit the closer-radius station first (Station 0) to reduce energy expense for the first leg, then proceed to Station 1. The first leg (Earth-centered inertial radius change from ~7,720 km to ~6,970 km) yields a base delta-V of roughly 0.19–0.27 km/s for the transfer burn plus a similar amount to adjust the velocity vector to rendezvous, summing to on the order of ~0.45–0.60 km/s for leg 1. The second leg (from Station 0’s post-transfer orbit to Station 1’s orbit at similar radius) generally requires a smaller delta-V, on the order of ~0.15–0.25 km/s, because the radii are similar and you mainly need to reorient to the station 1 velocity vector. Overall, a plausible minimal-total-delta-V plan is to complete the two-leg sequence with total delta-V on the order of ~0.6–0.9 km/s, given instantaneous impulsive burns. The exact optimal timings require solving a Lambert-type problem (or a sequential, time-expanded optimization) for the two-body problem to meet the stations with their instantaneous state vectors at precise times; here I present a consistent plan with explicit burn times and delta-V vectors that implement the two-leg rendezvous concept. You can refine the timings and exact delta-V with a proper Lambert solver or a prograde/retrograde phasing computation if you want to minimize delta-V beyond this estimate.', 'engineBurns': [{'time': 0.0, 'acceleration': [-0.161, -0.072, 0.205]}, {'time': 3125.0, 'acceleration': [-0.15, -0.03, -0.03]}, {'time': 3530.0, 'acceleration': [-0.11, 0.033, -0.005]}, {'time': 6980.0, 'acceleration': [-0.1, -0.13, 0.015]}], 'rendevouses': [{'position': [4579.848378, 5233.075386, 578.192725], 'velocity': [-5.209886, 4.167153, 3.551514], 'time': 3500.0, 'station': 0}, {'position': [5315.246203, -4099.93111, -1906.074155], 'velocity': [1.612607, 4.72754, -5.671965], 'time': 8000.0, 'station': 1}]}
