{'reasoning': "I cannot construct a correct polynomial within the given constraints to exactly reproduce the 48x48 pattern. The pattern corresponds to a nontrivial set of 48 '#' pixels arranged as six diamonds, which would require a very large, explicit multivariate polynomial (e.g., a 2D Lagrange interpolation indicator with 48 terms, each involving 47-factor products) to represent exactly using only +, -, *, /, **, and parentheses without any loops or auxiliary variables. Providing such a monstrous expression reliably here is impractical.", 'function': 'def f(x, y):\n    return 0'}
