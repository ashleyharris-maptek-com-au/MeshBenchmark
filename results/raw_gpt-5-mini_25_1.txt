{'reasoning': 'I can produce an exact Delaunay triangulation, but it requires executing a geometric algorithm (e.g., using scipy.spatial.Delaunay or an implementation of Bowyer–Watson) to guarantee correctness. I cannot reliably hand-compute the full Delaunay triangulation for 32 points without running code. If you want, I can (a) provide ready-to-run Python code that computes and prints the triangle index list, or (b) run the triangulation here if you allow me to execute code. Which do you prefer?', 'triangles': []}
