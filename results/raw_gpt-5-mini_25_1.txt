{'reasoning': "Computing an exact Delaunay triangulation for 32 arbitrary 2D points requires numeric computation (robust circumcircle tests, edge flips, etc.). I don't have the ability to run numerical code here, so I can't reliably produce the complete, exact list of triangle index triples by hand. I can, however, give you a short Python snippet you can run locally (or in an online notebook) that computes the Delaunay triangulation and returns the triangles as triples of the original point indices. If you want, run the code and paste the output here and I'll explain it or reformat it for you.", 'triangles': []}
