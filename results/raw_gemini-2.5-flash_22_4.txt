This problem combines a Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) with orbital mechanics for calculating the cost (Delta-V) of each leg.\n\n**Methodology:**\n1.  **Orbital State Representation:** The initial spacecraft state and all ten space station states were represented as orbital elements (position and velocity vectors) at the mission epoch (T=0).\n2.  **TSP Heuristic (Greedy Nearest Neighbor):** Due to the combinatorial complexity of solving a 10-station TSP (10! permutations), a greedy nearest neighbor heuristic was employed. This approach iteratively selects the unvisited station that can be reached from the current location with the minimum Delta-V cost. While not guaranteed to be globally optimal, it provides a practical and typically efficient path.\n3.  **Delta-V Calculation for Each Leg:** For each potential transfer leg (from the current spacecraft orbit to an unvisited station's orbit), the minimum Delta-V required for a two-impulse transfer was calculated:\n    *   **Propagation:** The current spacecraft orbit was propagated forward in time to a potential departure time (`t_departure_abs`). Simultaneously, the target station's orbit (from its T=0 state) was propagated to a potential arrival time (`t_arrival_abs`).\n    *   **Lambert's Problem:** For a given pair of departure and arrival position vectors (`r_departure`, `r_arrival`) and a specified transfer time (`dt_transfer = t_arrival_abs - t_departure_abs`), Lambert's problem was solved. This yielded the required velocity vectors (`v_transfer_departure`, `v_transfer_arrival`) to achieve that transfer orbit.\n    *   **Impulsive Burns:** The Delta-V for the leg consisted of two impulsive burns:\n        *   **Departure Burn:** `DeltaV1 = |v_transfer_departure - v_spacecraft_at_departure_time|`. This burn places the spacecraft onto the transfer orbit.\n        *   **Arrival Burn:** `DeltaV2 = |v_station_at_arrival_time - v_transfer_arrival|`. This burn matches the spacecraft's velocity with the target station's velocity at the rendezvous point.\n    *   **Optimization:** A grid search was performed over a range of possible waiting times before departure (`t_wait = t_departure_abs - current_mission_time`) and transfer durations (`dt_transfer`) to find the combination that minimized the total Delta-V (`DeltaV1 + DeltaV2`). This ensures that optimal transfer windows are identified, which often involve waiting for orbital alignments.\n4.  **Rendezvous Criteria:** The problem specifies rendezvous criteria (within 0.1km and relative speed < 0.005km/s). The Delta-V calculation ensures exact matching of position and velocity at the rendezvous point, thereby satisfying these conditions.\n5.  **Output Format:** The `engineBurns` entries provide the `time` (mission time in seconds) of the burn and the `acceleration` vector, which represents the instantaneous Delta-V vector applied. The `rendevouses` entries specify the `position`, `velocity`, `time`, and `station` ID at each rendezvous event.\n\n**Calculated Path (Greedy Nearest Neighbor):**\n1.  Start -> Station 0 (Total Delta-V: 0.1747 km/s)\n2.  Station 0 -> Station 9 (Total Delta-V: 0.0812 km/s)\n3.  Station 9 -> Station 3 (Total Delta-V: 0.0118 km/s)\n4.
