{'reasoning': "The problem asks for points touched by a rubber band stretched around the scene, which is equivalent to finding the convex hull of the given points. I used the Monotone Chain algorithm (a variant of Graham Scan) to achieve this. First, I parsed the input into Point objects, storing their original indices. Duplicate (x,y) coordinates were handled by keeping only one Point object for each unique (x,y) location (the one encountered first when processing the input). The points were then sorted lexicographically by x-coordinate, then y-coordinate. Two passes were made: one to build the upper hull and one to build the lower hull. In each pass, points are added to a stack (or list). Any point that would create a non-left (right or collinear) turn with the last two points on the stack is popped to maintain convexity, ensuring only extreme vertices are kept. Finally, the upper and lower hulls are combined, removing duplicate endpoints, to form the complete convex hull. The original indices of these hull points are then extracted and sorted numerically to produce the final 'pointSequence'.", 'pointSequence': [8, 17, 36, 55, 90, 101, 109, 110, 117]}
