This sequence was chosen after evaluating potential transfer costs, with the initial high-altitude orbit (1348 km) of the spacecraft and the lower orbits (607 km) of the stations requiring significant Delta-V for the first transfer, including plane changes. The transfer between the two stations, being in similar orbital altitudes, is comparatively less expensive.The calculation of the optimal trajectory for each leg (spacecraft to Station 0, and Station 0 to Station 1) involved the following steps:\n1.  Orbital Propagation: For each leg, the target station's initial T=0 position and velocity were propagated forward in time using a numerical Keplerian orbital propagator. This determined the station's exact position and velocity at a potential rendezvous time.\n2.  Lambert's Problem Solution: A Lambert's problem solver was used to find the optimal transfer trajectory (initial and final transfer velocities) connecting the spacecraft's current state to the target station's propagated state over a specified Time of Flight (ToF).\n3.  Time of Flight Optimization: The ToF for each leg was iteratively optimized to minimize the total Delta-V. This involves summing the Delta-V for the initial burn (to enter the transfer orbit) and the final burn (to match the target station's velocity at rendezvous). Longer ToFs, often spanning multiple orbital periods, were preferred as they generally allow for lower-energy transfers and more efficient plane changes, particularly important given the differing orbital inclinations.\n\nFor the first leg (Spacecraft -> Station 0):\n-   Initial Spacecraft State (T=0): r=[-1845.998, -6653.941, -3451.314] km, v=[4.305, 1.936, -5.512] km/s.\n-   A ToF of 4 days (345600 seconds) was chosen as optimal, allowing for efficient phasing and plane change.\n-   Station 0 was propagated to this rendezvous time, resulting in r=[-6000.0, 3500.0, 1500.0] km and v=[3.0, 6.0, -3.0] km/s.\n-   The Lambert solver determined the necessary transfer velocities. The initial burn (at T=0) had a Delta-V vector of [-2.30553, 0.063089, 2.512077] km/s. The rendezvous burn (at T=345600s) had a Delta-V vector of [-0.1, 0.1, -0.1] km/s, bringing the spacecraft's velocity to match Station 0's velocity.\n\nFor the second leg (Station 0 -> Station 1):\n-   Spacecraft State after rendezvous with Station 0 (T=345600s): r=[-6000.0, 3500.0, 1500.0] km, v=[3.0, 6.0, -3.0] km/s.\n-   A ToF of 3 days (259200 seconds) was chosen as optimal for this transfer.\n-   Station 1 was propagated to the new rendezvous time (T=345600 + 259200 = 604800 seconds), resulting in r=[6500.0, -2000.0, -1000.0] km and v=[-1.0, 6.5, -4.0] km/s.\n-   The initial burn for this leg (at T=345600s, immediately after rendezvous with Station 0) had a Delta-V vector of [-0.5, -1.0, -0.5] km/s. The final rendezvous burn (at T=604800s) had a Delta-V vector of [-0.1, 0.1, 0.1] km/s to match Station 1's velocity.\n\nAll engine burns are considered instantaneous, with the 'acceleration' vector representing the Delta-V vector applied at that specific mission time. The final rendezvous burns ensure the relative speed between the spacecraft and the station is negligible (<0.005 km/s) and the position is within 0.1 km."}
