{'reasoningAndDiscussion': "The primary challenge was to create a Python function `f(x, y)` for Australia's landmass (including Tasmania) within a 1024-byte limit, implementing Mercator projection and strict normalization, while outputting a positive value for 'inside' and non-positive for 'outside'.\n\n1.  **Coordinate Transformation:**\n    *   **Geographic References:** Four extreme points of Australia were selected: Cape York (QLD), South East Cape (TAS), Cape Byron (NSW), and Steep Point (WA). Their approximate latitude and longitude were used to define the boundaries of the normalized 2D space.\n    *   **Mercator Projection:** Standard Mercator formulas were applied: `x_merc = longitude_radians` and `y_merc = log(tan(pi/4 + latitude_radians/2))`. All angles were converted to radians.\n    *   **Normalization:** The calculated Mercator coordinates of these reference points were used to linearly map the Mercator space onto the `[0,0]` to `[1,1]` normalized square. The y-axis normalization was inverted (i.e., `(y_merc_CapeYork - y_merc) / (y_merc_CapeYork - y_merc_SouthEastCape)`) because Mercator `y` values decrease as latitude moves south, but the requirement was `y=0` at Cape York and `y=1` at South East Cape.\n\n2.  **Shape Representation (Implicit Surfaces):**\n    *   Due to the severe byte limitation, a high-fidelity representation of Australia's complex coastline was impossible. A simplified approach using implicit equations of two ellipses was chosen.\n    *   **Mainland Ellipse:** A large ellipse, `(2X-1)**2 + (2.5Y-1)**2 - 1`, was used to approximate the main Australian continent. This equation places the ellipse's center at `(0.5, 0.4)` in the normalized `[0,1]` x `[0,1]` space, with semi-axes `0.5` (X-axis) and `0.4` (Y-axis). This creates a wider-than-tall shape, roughly resembling the continent's general form.\n    *   **Tasmania Ellipse:** A smaller ellipse, `(12.5X-8.75)**2 + (20Y-18)**2 - 1`, was included for Tasmania. It is positioned approximately around `(0.7, 0.9)` in the normalized space, appropriately scaled and located south of the mainland representation.\n    *   **Union of Shapes:** For both ellipses, points `(X, Y)` inside satisfy the equation `<= 0`. To represent the union of these two shapes (mainland OR Tasmania), the `min` function was used: `min(A, B) <= 0` signifies a point inside either the mainland ellipse (`A`) or the Tasmania ellipse (`B`).\n    *   **Signed Output:** The problem requires `f(x,y) > 0` for ", 'minifiedCode': 'def f(x,y):P=math.pi;D=P/180;L=math.log;T=math.tan;x0,xr,y0,yr=1.9748,0.7066,-0.1856,0.6624;lt,ln=y*D,x*D;mx,my=ln,L(T(P/4+lt/2));X,Y=(mx-x0)/xr,(y0-my)/yr;A=(2*X-1)**2+(2.5*Y-1)**2-1;B=(12.5*X-8.75)**2+(20*Y-18)**2-1;return -min(A,B)'}
