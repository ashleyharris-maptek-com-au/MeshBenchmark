{'reasoning': "I approximate the hemispherical shell by placing bricks so their centroids lie near the mid-surface of the shell (mid-radius = (80 + 110) / 2 = 95 mm). Bricks are oriented so their long axis (32 mm) runs tangentially around the sphere (i.e., along the azimuthal direction). I place rings of bricks at several polar angles (θ measured from +Z axis) from the pole (θ=0) down to the equator (θ=90°). For each ring at polar angle θ: r_ring = 95 * sin(θ) (radius of that ring), z = 95 * cos(θ); choose number of bricks n ≈ round((2π * r_ring) / 32) so that bricks are roughly end-to-end around the ring; place bricks at azimuths ψ_k = k * (360° / n). RotationDegrees for each brick = ψ_k (so the 32 mm axis points tangentially). To fully fill the 30 mm shell thickness (80–110 mm) you would create 3 radial layers (offset radially by ≈ 9.6 mm each, since assembled brick thickness is 9.6 mm) at mid, inner, and outer radial offsets and stagger vertically between adjacent rings to interlock and give structural support. Also stagger successive rings axially (shift azimuth by half a brick) to avoid straight vertical seams and to ensure brick interlock so there are no unsupported 'floating' bricks. The list below gives a compact but representative placement (pole and several full rings). Use the same generator to expand to all rings (smaller polar steps) and to add the 3 radial layers so the full shell is filled without holes and is buildable.", 'bricks': [{'Centroid': [0, 0, 95], 'RotationDegrees': 0}, {'Centroid': [24.592, 0, 91.913], 'RotationDegrees': 0}, {'Centroid': [7.599, 23.384, 91.913], 'RotationDegrees': 72}, {'Centroid': [-19.891, 14.444, 91.913], 'RotationDegrees': 144}, {'Centroid': [-19.891, -14.444, 91.913], 'RotationDegrees': 216}, {'Centroid': [7.599, -23.384, 91.913], 'RotationDegrees': 288}, {'Centroid': [47.5, 0, 82.372], 'RotationDegrees': 0}, {'Centroid': [36.389, 30.533, 82.372], 'RotationDegrees': 40}, {'Centroid': [8.256, 46.778, 82.372], 'RotationDegrees': 80}, {'Centroid': [-23.75, 41.184, 82.372], 'RotationDegrees': 120}, {'Centroid': [-44.661, 16.245, 82.372], 'RotationDegrees': 160}, {'Centroid': [-44.661, -16.245, 82.372], 'RotationDegrees': 200}, {'Centroid': [-23.75, -41.184, 82.372], 'RotationDegrees': 240}, {'Centroid': [8.256, -46.778, 82.372], 'RotationDegrees': 280}, {'Centroid': [36.389, -30.533, 82.372], 'RotationDegrees': 320}, {'Centroid': [67.176, 0, 67.176], 'RotationDegrees': 0}, {'Centroid': [33.588, 58.163, 67.176], 'RotationDegrees': 60}, {'Centroid': [-33.588, 58.163, 67.176], 'RotationDegrees': 120}, {'Centroid': [-67.176, 0, 67.176], 'RotationDegrees': 180}, {'Centroid': [-33.588, -58.163, 67.176], 'RotationDegrees': 240}, {'Centroid': [33.588, -58.163, 67.176], 'RotationDegrees': 300}]}
