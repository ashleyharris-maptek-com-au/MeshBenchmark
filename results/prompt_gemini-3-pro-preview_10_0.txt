You are a painter, you have a canvas of size 16 * 16 pixels.

You are painting a scene from the north east, at a 45 degree angle looking down. You are using an orthographic projection.

The scene contains 5 axis aligned cubes, each with a side length of 1 unit. The cubes bottom-centres are placed at the vertices of a 
regular pentagram of side length 5 units, centred at the origin, aligned so it's 'pointing' positive y, 
and is centred in the middle of your painting.

Your painting is zoomed such that the outer edges of the cubes touch the edges of the canvas.

Return the canvas as a string, with:
- # representing a surface facing up (the top plane of a cube)
- " representing a surface facing east or west.
- ' representing a surface facing north or south.
- (space) representing unpainted pixels, the ground, sky, pentagram or anything else.
