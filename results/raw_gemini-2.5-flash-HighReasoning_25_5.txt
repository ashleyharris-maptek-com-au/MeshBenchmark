{'reasoning': "To form a collection of triangles that satisfies the given criteria (no edges crossing, no points inside, every point contributes, minimum angles maximised), a Delaunay Triangulation algorithm is the most suitable method. This algorithm constructs triangles such that no point in the dataset is inside the circumcircle of any triangle formed by three points. This 'empty circumcircle' property intrinsically maximises the minimum angle among all possible triangulations for a given set of points, thus avoiding 'skinny' triangles and promoting well-shaped ones. The process typically involves an incremental approach (like Bowyer-Watson) or a divide-and-conquer strategy, starting from a convex hull and iteratively adding points or merging sub-triangulations while maintaining the Delaunay property.", 'triangles': [[0, 17, 4], [4, 15, 19], [1, 3, 12], [2, 7, 9], [5, 6, 10], [13, 14, 26], [8, 11, 16]]}
