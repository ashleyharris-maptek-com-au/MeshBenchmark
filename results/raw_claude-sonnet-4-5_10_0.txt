{'reasoning': "I need to paint 5 cubes positioned at the vertices of a regular pentagram. Let me work through this step by step:\n\n1. Pentagram vertices with side length 5, pointing up (positive y):\n   - A pentagram has 5 points. With center at origin and pointing up:\n   - Top point: (0, 5*cos(18°)) ≈ (0, 4.755)\n   - Upper right: (5*sin(54°), 5*cos(54°)) ≈ (4.045, 2.939)\n   - Lower right: (5*sin(18°), -5*cos(18°)) ≈ (1.545, -4.755)\n   - Lower left: (-5*sin(18°), -5*cos(18°)) ≈ (-1.545, -4.755)\n   - Upper left: (-5*sin(54°), 5*cos(54°)) ≈ (-4.045, 2.939)\n\n2. View from northeast at 45° looking down (orthographic):\n   - Northeast means 45° from north (positive y) toward east (positive x)\n   - This is a standard isometric-like view\n   - Transform: x' = x*cos(45°) + y*sin(45°), y' = z - x*sin(45°) + y*cos(45°)\n   - Simplified for 45°: x' = (x+y)/√2, y' = z + (-x+y)/√2\n\n3. Each cube has side length 1, positioned at bottom-center.\n\n4. For each cube at position (x,y), the bottom is at z=0, top at z=1.\n   - Top face (z=1): projects to screen\n   - North face (y+0.5): visible if facing camera\n   - South face (y-0.5): visible if facing camera  \n   - East face (x+0.5): visible if facing camera\n   - West face (x-0.5): visible if facing camera\n\n5. From NE view, we see top faces, and the south and west faces of cubes.\n\nLet me calculate the projected positions and draw on 16x16 canvas:", 'painting': '                \n                \n      ##        \n      "#        \n     \'"##      \n     \'\'"#      \n  ##  \'\'       \n  "#            \n \'"##          \n \'\'"#    ##    \n  \'\'    "#    \n       \'"##   \n       \'\'"#   \n        \'\'    \n                \n                '}
