Generate a 128 * 128 ASCII art maze.

The maze must use the following characters:
# - Wall
. - Correct solution path
A - Start
B - End
  - Untaken path (space)

The maze must be solvable, there must be only one solution, the annotated path must not have any loops or branches, and shortest path
from A to B must cover at least 10% of the maze area. The path threw the maze can only be 1 cell wide, and solvable with
only horizontal or vertical moves.

The maze must be 'watertight', that is have walls touching the border of the grid all around, A and B must be within the maze.

Return the maze as a string, with newlines between rows. 
Every row and column of your output must be 128 characters long, and your output must be 128 rows long.
Outputting anything else than the maze will obviously result in a score of 0.
