{'reasoning': "The initial world consists of a flat dirt layer at z=[0,1,2], with air above. Rainfall occurs at the top center (approximately x=11, y=11) and is described as '1000s of voxels worth'. The goal is to ensure that, after the rains end, there are three unconnected bodies of water, each at least 2x2 voxels in area. To achieve this, I will create three distinct and isolated depressions or basins by replacing sections of the dirt layer at z=2 with air.\n\nEach basin will be a 4x4 voxel area, providing ample space (exceeding the 2x2 minimum) for water to pool. The floor of these basins will be the existing dirt at z=1, effectively creating a 1-voxel deep pit (at z=2) where water can collect. The locations chosen for the basins are:\n1.  Basin A: x from 3 to 6, y from 3 to 6 (at z=2)\n2.  Basin B: x from 17 to 20, y from 3 to 6 (at z=2)\n3.  Basin C: x from 3 to 6, y from 17 to 20 (at z=2)\n\nThese basins are strategically placed far from each other, ensuring that the solid dirt at z=2 between and around them remains intact. This guarantees that any water pooling in one basin cannot flow into another, thus maintaining their unconnected status.\n\nRegarding water collection: Rainfall at the top center (11,11) will fall through air until it hits the dirt surface at (11,11,2). According to the rules, if water is on ground (dirt at z=2) and has ground below it (dirt at z=1), it 'flood fills' out looking for any air voxels at the z level below it, and moves to the nearest one. The edges of the world (x=0, x=23, y=0, y=23) act as points where water is lost (effectively an 'air voxel at z-1'). However, the created basins, being areas of air at z=2 with a dirt floor at z=1, also represent 'air voxels at the z level below' (relative to water attempting to flow horizontally at z=2).\n\nThe Manhattan distance from the rainfall origin (11,11) to the closest map edge is 11 units. The Manhattan distance from (11,11) to the nearest edge of any basin (e.g., to (6,6) for Basin A) is 5 units horizontally + 5 units vertically = 10 units. Since the basins are closer than the map edges, the abundant rainfall will preferentially flow into and fill these three isolated 4x4 depressions. Each pit will thus form a body of water at z=2 (resting on dirt at z=1) that is at least 4x4 in surface area and unconnected from the others, satisfying all requirements.", 'voxels': [{'xyz': [3, 3, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [4, 3, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [5, 3, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [6, 3, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [3, 4, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [4, 4, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [5, 4, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [6, 4, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [3, 5, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [4, 5, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [5, 5, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [6, 5, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [3, 6, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [4, 6, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [5, 6, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [6, 6, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [17, 3, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [18, 3, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [19, 3, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [20, 3, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [17, 4, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [18, 4, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [19, 4, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [20, 4, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [17, 5, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [18, 5, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [19, 5, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [20, 5, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [17, 6, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [18, 6, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [19, 6, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [20, 6, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [3, 17, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [4, 17, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [5, 17, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [6, 17, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [3, 18, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [4, 18, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [5, 18, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [6, 18, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [3, 19, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [4, 19, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [5, 19, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [6, 19, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [3, 20, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [4, 20, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [5, 20, 2], 'material': 'Air'}, {'xyz': [6, 20, 2], 'material': 'Air'}]}
