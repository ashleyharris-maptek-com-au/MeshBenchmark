{'reasoning': "The pattern consists of 6 identical 'cross' shapes. Each shape can be described by an integer reference point (cx, cy), which is the center of its middle horizontal line segment. For a given shape with center (cx, cy):\n- The '#' points are: (cx, cy-1), (cx+1, cy-1), (cx-1, cy), (cx, cy), (cx+1, cy), (cx+2, cy), (cx, cy+1), (cx+1, cy+1).\n- All other points in the 48x48 grid are '.'.\n\nI constructed a polynomial function `g(x, y, cx, cy)` that is strictly positive for these 8 '#' points of a single shape and less than or equal to zero for all other points. The function `g` is a sum of two components:\n1. A component for the middle horizontal segment: `A = (-(x-(cx-1))*(x-(cx+2)) + 1) * (-(y-cy)**2 + 1)`.\n   - The x-term `(-(x-(cx-1))*(x-(cx+2)) + 1)` is 1 at `x=cx-1` and `x=cx+2`. It's positive (value 3) at `x=cx` and `x=cx+1`. It's negative outside this range.\n   - The y-term `(-(y-cy)**2 + 1)` is 1 at `y=cy`, and 0 at `y=cy-1` and `y=cy+1`. It's negative for other `y` values.\n   - This product `A` is positive for `(x,y)` points on the middle horizontal line segment and zero/negative otherwise.\n2. A component for the two vertical end segments: `B = (-(x-cx)*(x-(cx+1)) + 1) * (-(y-(cy-1))*(y-(cy+1)) + 1)`.\n   - The x-term `(-(x-cx)*(x-(cx+1)) + 1)` is 1 at `x=cx` and `x=cx+1`. It's negative outside this range.\n   - The y-term `(-(y-(cy-1))*(y-(cy+1)) + 1)` is 1 at `y=cy-1` and `y=cy+1`. It's positive (value 2) at `y=cy`. It's negative for other `y` values.\n   - This product `B` is positive for `(x,y)` points on the vertical end segments and the overlapping central horizontal points, and zero/negative otherwise.\n\nWhen `A` and `B` are summed (`g = A + B`):\n- For `(cx, cy)`: `A=3, B=2`, so `g=5 > 0`.\n- For `(cx+1, cy)`: `A=3, B=2`, so `g=5 > 0`.\n- For `(cx-1, cy)`: `A=1, B=-2`, so `g=-1 <= 0`. (Correctly marks this '.' despite it being a target `x` for `A`).\n- For `(cx+2, cy)`: `A=1, B=-2`, so `g=-1 <= 0`. (Correctly marks this '.' despite it being a target `x` for `A`).\n- For `(cx, cy-1)`: `A=0, B=1`, so `g=1 > 0`.\n- For `(cx+1, cy-1)`: `A=0, B=1`, so `g=1 > 0`.\n- For `(cx, cy+1)`: `A=0, B=1`, so `g=1 > 0`.\n- For `(cx+1, cy+1)`: `A=0, B=1`, so `g=1 > 0`.\n\nThe final function `f(x,y)` is the sum of these `g` functions for each of the 6 shape centers identified from the grid:\n- Shape 1: (cx=34, cy=3)\n- Shape 2a: (cx=7, cy=10)\n- Shape 2b: (cx=21, cy=10)\n- Shape 2c: (cx=35, cy=10)\n- Shape 3: (cx=31, cy=21)\n- Shape 4: (cx=21, cy=36)\n\nThis construction ensures that for any cell (x, y):\n- If (x,y) is a '#' point of any shape, at least one `g` term will contribute a positive value, and other `g` terms will contribute 0 or negative values without making the sum non-positive (since the shapes are spaced far enough apart for their negative influences not to overlap with positive regions).\n- If (x,y) is a '.' point, all `g` terms will contribute 0 or negative values, making the total sum non-positive.", 'function': 'def f(x, y):\n    s1 = ((-(x-33)*(x-36) + 1) * (-(y-3)**2 + 1) + ((-(x-34)*(x-35) + 1) * (-(y-2)*(y-4) + 1)))\n    s2 = ((-(x-6)*(x-9) + 1) * (-(y-10)**2 + 1) + ((-(x-7)*(x-8) + 1) * (-(y-9)*(y-11) + 1)))\n    s3 = ((-(x-20)*(x-23) + 1) * (-(y-10)**2 + 1) + ((-(x-21)*(x-22) + 1) * (-(y-9)*(y-11) + 1)))\n    s4 = ((-(x-34)*(x-37) + 1) * (-(y-10)**2 + 1) + ((-(x-35)*(x-36) + 1) * (-(y-9)*(y-11) + 1)))\n    s5 = ((-(x-30)*(x-33) + 1) * (-(y-21)**2 + 1) + ((-(x-31)*(x-32) + 1) * (-(y-20)*(y-22) + 1)))\n    s6 = ((-(x-20)*(x-23) + 1) * (-(y-36)**2 + 1) + ((-(x-21)*(x-22) + 1) * (-(y-35)*(y-37) + 1)))\n    return s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5 + s6'}
