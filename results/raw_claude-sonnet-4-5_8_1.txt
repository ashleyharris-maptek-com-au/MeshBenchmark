{'reasoning': "I need to find a polynomial function f(x,y) that is positive (>) 0 for cells marked with '#' and non-positive (<=) 0 for cells marked with '.'. \n\nLooking at the grid:\n- Row 0: # from x=0-7, . from x=8-11\n- Row 1: # from x=0-5, . from x=6-11\n- Row 2: # from x=0-3, . from x=4-11\n- Row 3: # from x=0-2, . from x=3-11\n- Row 4: # from x=0-2, . from x=3-11\n- Row 5: # from x=0-1, . from x=2-11\n- Row 6: # from x=0-1, . from x=2-11\n- Row 7: # at x=0, . from x=1-11\n- Rows 8-11: all '.'\n\nThe boundary appears to follow a diagonal-like pattern. For each row y, the '#' symbols end around x = 8-y for early rows. Let me check:\n- y=0: ends at x=7 (8-0=8, close)\n- y=1: ends at x=5 (8-1=7, off by 2)\n- y=2: ends at x=3 (8-2=6, off by 3)\n\nActually, looking more carefully:\n- y=0: x<=7 has #\n- y=1: x<=5 has #\n- y=2: x<=3 has #\n- y=3,4: x<=2 has #\n- y=5,6: x<=1 has #\n- y=7: x<=0 has #\n- y>=8: no #\n\nThis suggests a relationship like x + y*k < threshold. Let me try x + 2*y < 8:\n- y=0: x<8 (but we want x<=7, so x<8 works)\n- y=1: x<6 (we want x<=5, so x<6 works)\n- y=2: x<4 (we want x<=3, so x<4 works)\n- y=3: x<2 (we want x<=2, so x<3 needed)\n\nTrying x + 1.5*y < 8 or similar. Let me use: 8 - x - 1.5*y > 0 for #\nBut I need integers. Let me try: 16 - 2*x - 3*y > 0", 'function': 'def f(x, y):\n    return 16 - 2*x - 3*y'}
