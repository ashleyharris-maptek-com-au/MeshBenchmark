You are given a 3D voxel world, of dimensions 24 * 24 * 8 voxels,
currently filled with dirt uniformly flat and solid at the layers z = [0,1,2]

Rainfall occurs at the top centre of the world, and follows the following rules:
- If air is below water, the water falls (z = z - 1)
- If water has ground or water below it, it "flood fills" out looking for any air voxels 
  at the z level below it, and moves to the nearest one.
- If water touches the sides or bottom of the world, it falls off and is lost forever.
- If water can't find a reachable air voxel to walk to, it remains there as a pool of water.

Rainfall currently all runs off the edge of the map, meaning earthworks are required to achieve
your goals. After your earthworks complete, there will be 1000s of voxels worth of rainfall
before your world is graded.

Add dirt or air voxels to the world in order to accomplish your task:

Ensure that; after the rains end,
there are 3 unconnected bodies of water each at least 2x2
