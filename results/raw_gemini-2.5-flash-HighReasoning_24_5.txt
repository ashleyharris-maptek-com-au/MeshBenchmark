{'reasoning': "The problem asks for all points touched by a rubber band stretched around the scene, which is equivalent to finding the convex hull of the given set of points. The Monotone Chain algorithm (Andrew's algorithm) is an efficient method to compute the convex hull. The algorithm proceeds as follows: 1. All points are first sorted lexicographically (primarily by x-coordinate, then by y-coordinate). This sorting ensures a consistent sweep direction. 2. The 'lower hull' is constructed by iterating through the sorted points. For each point, it is added to a hull list. If adding the point creates a 'right turn' (clockwise orientation) with respect to the last two points in the hull, the second-to-last point is popped. This process continues until a 'left turn' (counter-clockwise) or collinear orientation is formed. The cross-product `(p2.x - p1.x) * (p3.y - p1.y) - (p2.y - p1.y) * (p3.x - p1.x)` is used to determine the orientation. A negative cross-product indicates a right turn. By checking for `< 0`, we ensure that collinear points on an edge are included in the hull. 3. The 'upper hull' is constructed similarly, but by iterating through the sorted points in reverse order. The same cross-product logic applies, ensuring that the upper chain also makes left turns (when viewed from its direction of construction) or remains collinear. 4. Finally, the complete convex hull is formed by concatenating the lower hull and the upper hull. To avoid duplicate points (the leftmost and rightmost points are part of both hulls), the unique point IDs are collected into a single list. The points from the lower hull are added first, then the intermediate points from the upper hull (excluding its first and last points, which correspond to the rightmost and leftmost points already added by the lower hull). A set is used to track seen point IDs to ensure uniqueness while preserving the counter-clockwise order of the hull vertices.", 'pointSequence': [8, 129, 103, 74, 161, 229, 508, 769, 396, 830, 3, 56, 37, 58, 38, 270, 369, 105, 35, 231, 335, 157, 434, 49, 196, 260, 798, 310, 97, 326, 931, 17, 167, 893, 505, 376, 34, 955, 6, 137, 518, 445, 512, 62, 917, 654, 241, 672, 393, 203, 329, 96, 865, 238, 713, 576, 75, 570, 191, 1015, 79, 607, 555, 99, 18, 928, 233, 338, 240, 510, 868, 85, 355, 929, 271, 481, 301, 248, 693, 857, 756, 91, 259, 622, 119, 841, 957, 744, 60, 450, 353, 650, 594, 801, 671, 99, 222, 18, 959, 813, 797, 100, 530, 453, 648, 339, 22, 605, 66, 68, 976, 375, 884, 973, 909, 971, 86, 965, 138, 455, 499, 975, 666, 652, 694, 922, 197, 424, 778, 945, 45, 13, 965, 433, 148, 226, 836, 870, 775, 888, 727, 336, 848, 891, 435, 357, 172, 281, 438, 663, 932, 117, 261, 93, 48, 110, 92, 996, 642, 474, 717, 252, 536, 726, 305, 755, 725, 863, 950, 420, 545, 591, 977, 571, 486, 871, 171, 832, 705, 193, 55, 120, 258, 315, 912, 54, 98, 633, 403, 257, 905, 731, 421, 348, 380, 904, 436, 367, 488, 44, 712, 51, 31, 135, 698, 700, 95, 704, 482, 652, 1014, 41, 736, 459, 140, 1013, 821, 579, 109, 411, 537, 678, 425, 598, 819, 14, 899, 73, 11, 970, 805, 36, 290, 256, 332, 645, 472, 614, 30, 1007, 475, 143, 810, 787, 793, 846, 187, 910, 147, 783, 551, 43, 224, 361, 9, 46, 177, 718, 181, 790, 101, 126, 513, 470, 204, 699, 941, 2, 415, 948, 309, 232, 379, 544, 812, 444, 595, 263, 409, 125, 78, 990, 986, 649, 439, 683, 245, 327, 940, 997, 1002, 597, 210, 131, 166, 560, 373, 107, 860, 861, 10, 111, 149, 159, 239, 771, 220, 972, 746, 543, 365, 185, 908, 523, 19, 175, 496, 253, 541, 254, 222, 558, 690, 742, 21, 709, 967, 1003, 23, 142, 471, 24, 123, 154, 686, 559, 837, 18, 952, 862, 449, 244, 569, 982, 602, 255, 732, 896, 51, 478, 342, 59, 32, 267, 573, 3, 889, 33, 278, 816, 923, 180, 493, 40, 133, 422, 41, 880, 864, 47, 981, 1018, 322, 1017, 464, 504, 784, 225, 401, 503, 927, 176, 414, 152, 124, 583, 791, 354, 155, 12, 127, 134, 136, 228, 385, 419, 207, 128, 529, 763, 1010, 183, 701, 243, 627, 609, 302, 113, 285, 33, 268, 492, 934, 734, 660, 928, 98, 233, 338, 83, 992, 780, 540, 218, 249, 589, 418, 14, 925, 76, 1015, 570, 191, 7, 823, 75, 192, 673, 535, 82, 238, 616, 70, 1, 393, 63, 407]}
