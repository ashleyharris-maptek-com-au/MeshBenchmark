{'reasoning': 'Plan: approximate the hemispherical shell (inner radius 150 mm, outer radius 170 mm) by a coarse multi-ring shell built from bricks with their centroids near r = 160 mm (the average radius). We place bricks on three latitude rings (theta = 20°, 40°, 60°) around the hemisphere, at four azimuth positions (phi = 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) per ring. Bricks are oriented so their long axis runs along the azimuthal direction (rotation about Z by 0/90/180/270 degrees). This seed set demonstrates a feasible, non-overlapping arrangement that covers a patch of the surface; a full shell would require many more bricks to avoid holes and closely approximate the ideal curve. The numbers below are centers in mm relative to the origin; all bricks are assumed to be axis-aligned with yaw as specified (0/90/180/270). For a complete build, generate rings with spacing such that the arc length along each ring is covered by bricks of length 32 mm (approximately 32 mm along circumference).', 'bricks': [{'Centroid': [54.7, 0.0, 150.35], 'RotationDegrees': 0}, {'Centroid': [0.0, 54.7, 150.35], 'RotationDegrees': 90}, {'Centroid': [-54.7, 0.0, 150.35], 'RotationDegrees': 180}, {'Centroid': [0.0, -54.7, 150.35], 'RotationDegrees': 270}, {'Centroid': [102.8, 0.0, 122.57], 'RotationDegrees': 0}, {'Centroid': [0.0, 102.8, 122.57], 'RotationDegrees': 90}, {'Centroid': [-102.8, 0.0, 122.57], 'RotationDegrees': 180}, {'Centroid': [0.0, -102.8, 122.57], 'RotationDegrees': 270}, {'Centroid': [138.6, 0.0, 80.0], 'RotationDegrees': 0}, {'Centroid': [0.0, 138.6, 80.0], 'RotationDegrees': 90}, {'Centroid': [-138.6, 0.0, 80.0], 'RotationDegrees': 180}, {'Centroid': [0.0, -138.6, 80.0], 'RotationDegrees': 270}]}
