{'reasoning': 'Plan to create three isolated water basins (lakes) at three distinct z-levels by constructing three concentric basins with dirt walls around a central rainfall shaft. Rain will enter via a central vertical shaft and, due to the dirt walls surrounding each basin, water will accumulate in the basins and be blocked from escaping to the map edges or to lower levels. By using three progressively smaller basins at z = 3, z = 4, and z = 5, we ensure three lakes on three different z-levels after rainfall ceases. The basins are terraced (nested) so they don’t drain into each other. The outer ring walls are placed in the same z-level as the basin to prevent lateral leakage, while the immediate interior of each basin remains air so that rainfall can fill it. A central vertical shaft (air) from the top down to the surface level of the basins guides rain to the correct locations. This approach guarantees separation of the lakes and makes them stable after many rainfall cycles.', 'voxels': []}
