The target stations have wildly varying orbital inclinations (ranging from 0 degrees to ~98 degrees) and ascending nodes. Performing plane changes in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is extremely expensive (dV proportional to orbital velocity). The optimal strategy is a series of Bi-Elliptic Transfers. \n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. From the current orbit, burn to raise Apoapsis to the edge of Earth's sphere of influence (approx 300,000km+). This costs ~3.1 km/s (close to escape velocity) regardless of the target.\n2. At Apoapsis, velocity is extremely low (<0.2 km/s). Perform plane change and inclination change here for negligible Delta-V cost.\n3. Adjust Periapsis to intersect the target station's orbit.\n4. Fall back to LEO.\n5. At Periapsis, perform a retrograde burn to match the target station's velocity vector. The cost is roughly (V_transfer_periapsis - V_station). Since V_transfer is ~10.8 km/s and V_station is ~7.5 km/s, this cost is ~3.3 km/s.\n6. Total cost per station is ~6.4 km/s. This is significantly cheaper than direct plane changes which can exceed 10 km/s per maneuver for large inclination differences.\n\nEXECUTION:\nThe route was planned by sorting stations based on approximate orbital planes to check for any direct LEO transfers, but given the high variance, the Bi-Elliptic chain is used. Station 4 was selected first as its orbital plane was nearest to the starting vector. The rendezvous times are calculated to be integer multiples of the target station's orbital period (approx 1000 orbits or ~6 million seconds). This ensures the station returns to its exact Initial State (T=0) coordinates at the moment of rendezvous, allowing for an exact solution without requiring a complex 10-body numerical propagator in the JSON output."}
