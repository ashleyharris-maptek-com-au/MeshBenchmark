{'reasoning': "The maze is a 16x16 grid. The solution path travels from A (1,1) to B (13,13) in a winding 'snake' pattern to maximize length (>10% area) and cover the grid. The path moves East-South-West-South repeatedly. Dead ends (spaces) are added in the 'walls' between path segments to ensure the maze is not just a single line, adhering to the 'untaken path' requirement. Loops are prevented by ensuring dead ends branch from the path but do not reconnect to it or each other. Walls (#) surround the grid and separate branches.", 'maze': '################\n#A...........  #\n## # # # # # ###\n### # # # # #. #\n###...........##\n#  . ### # # # #\n###.# # # # ####\n###........... #\n#  # # # # # .##\n##### # # # #. #\n###...........##\n#  . ### # # # #\n###.# # # # ####\n###..........B #\n#### # # # # ###\n################'}
