{'reasoning': "The problem asks for 'all the points the rubber band touches', which is a classic definition of the convex hull of a set of points. I will use the Andrew's Monotone Chain algorithm to find the convex hull. This algorithm involves sorting points and then building upper and lower hulls. To correctly handle input points with identical coordinates (e.g., points 3 and 71 at (28, 17)) and ensure all such indices are returned if their coordinate is a hull vertex, I will first preprocess the points to group all original indices by their (x, y) coordinates. The standard interpretation of 'points touched by a rubber band' typically refers to the vertices of the convex hull. The algorithm will exclude points that lie strictly inside any segment of the hull boundary.", 'pointSequence': [8, 11, 13, 17, 34, 36, 54, 55, 82, 86, 90, 100, 101, 109, 110, 117]}
