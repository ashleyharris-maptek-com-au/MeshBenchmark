**Evaluating signed distance functions**

I'm thinking about approximating Australia's landmass with a polygon in geographic coordinates and then applying the Mercator projection. The signed distance function should indicate if a point is inside or outside the polygon. I consider using a rasterized distance method to compute the distance to polygon edges. Alternatively, I could define an implicit function using half-space inequalities, but that's quite complex. A distance transform might be simpler, allowing me to return a negative value for points inside the polygon.**Constructing a signed distance function**

I’m thinking about creating a signed distance function where f > 0 indicates being inside the polygon. The prompt specifies that this function should return a positive value for points inside and a negative value for those outside. I can use ray casting to check if a point is inside the polygon, then calculate the minimum distance to the boundary. Incorporating Tasmania into the polygon means I'll need to list the latitude and longitude coordinates accurately to represent the coastline well. Also, using libraries like NumPy will help speed things up!**Applying Mercator projection**

I need to apply the Mercator projection, where x corresponds to the longitude in radians and y can be calculated using the formula y = R * ln(tan(π/4 + lat/2)). After obtaining the projected coordinates, I’ll need to normalize them to a 0-1 scale. To do this, I’ll determine the bounding box of these coordinates so that I can effectively map the inputs back to the normalized range. It’s important that the function can access the minimum and maximum values of the projected coordinates when needed!**Defining polygon coordinates**

I'm planning to implement static cached global arrays at the function module level. Since the code will be under 4k, I can embed approximate polygon coordinates representing Australia, including Tasmania. While it’s tricky to define precisely, I think an approximate shape will suffice for my purposes. I’ll create a simplified polygon using latitude and longitude points along the coastline, starting at around 141.0E on the eastern coast. I need to ensure it represents Australia’s landmass adequately without being overly complex!**Designing the polygon for Australia**

I’m working on creating a rough polygon that represents Australia's landmass, including Tasmania. I’ll start by defining points along the coastline which will approximate the shape of the mainland. It seems crucial to ensure Tasmania is included as a separate region in my calculations. I might use a method that combines half-planes or circles to approximate the silhouette instead of strict coordinates. I’ll apply the Mercator projection to these points, normalize them, and implement a point-in-polygon test in projected coordinates to determine if points are inside or outside the shape.**Implementing the distance function**

I’m working on the signed distance function for a polygon that includes both mainland Australia and Tasmania. To do this, I need to compute the minimum distance to the polygon's edges and ensure the points are processed in consistent units. I'll create a polygon for Tasmania and join it to the main polygon, ensuring the shape accommodates both landmasses. For the distance calculations, I'll use an array of longitude and latitude pairs. I'll also implement the Mercator projection to facilitate scale adjustments when evaluating distance and normalizing coordinates.**Drafting the polygon implementation**

I'm setting up the code to precompute the polygon points for both mainland Australia and Tasmania, then project them into 2D using Mercator projection. I plan to implement functions that determine if a point lies within the polygon and find the minimum distance to the edges. To keep the code under 4096 bytes, I'll condense variable names and omit comments. I’ll also need to define helper functions for distance calculations and ensure the final function handles multiple polygons efficiently while still returning accurate distances.**Optimizing polygon calculations**

I'm thinking about calculating points near the antimer and ensuring the code length stays within limits. To keep things concise, I'll use shorter variable names and limit whitespace, targeting around 1500-2000 bytes. I plan to stick with standard libraries like `math` instead of using NumPy for simplicity. I'll define polygons for mainland Australia and Tasmania with proper Mercator projections. Additionally, I need functions for testing point inclusion and calculating distances to edges, all while maintaining the 4096-byte cap.**Creating polygon coordinates**

I’m working on defining polygon coordinates for mainland Australia. The `_MAIN` variable is set up to outline the continent, looping back near 112 to -44 but doesn’t fully encapsulate the east coast—which might cause issues for boundary checking. There's also a small polygon for Tasmania, `_TAS`, with coordinates correctly defined. I need to ensure the code is clean and adheres to the 4096-byte limit, with necessary imports handled automatically. Finally, I’ll format the output in a JSON structure that includes a compact code snippet and minimal reasoning.**Crafting the final code**

I'm focused on creating a function that calculates distances in predefined polygons based on given coordinates. I'll ensure to define everything clearly, like the `_MIN_X`, `_MAX_X`, `_MIN_Y`, `_MAX_Y`, and polygon `_POLY`. It's essential to formulate the code efficiently while keeping it within a maximum character limit.

I'll present the final code in a JSON structure with a concise description in the reasoning field. The code will be clean but minimized, without extra spaces or unnecessary line breaks, and I'll ensure it returns numeric values. Time to finalize this step!
