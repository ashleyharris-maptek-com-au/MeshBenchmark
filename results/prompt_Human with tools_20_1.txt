Create a < 2048 bytes snippet of python code that exports a function 'f', taking 2 parameters (x and y),
that when executed returns a parametric shape representing Australia's land mass, including at least Tasmania.

f(x,y) > 0 represents "inside".
f(x,y) <= 0 represents "outside".
Use a mercartor projection to project from spherical to 2D.
Scale the 2D shape such that it fits within a normalised 0,0 -> 1,1
Cape York, QLD's tip is on the line y=0
South East Cape, TAS is on the line y=1
Cape Byron, NSW is on the line x=1
Steep Point, WAS, is on the line X=0
Comments are a waste of bytes, do not use them.
Coding standards & best practices are not enforced. Go nuts.
Will be executed in Python Version: sys.version_info(major=3, minor=12, micro=0, releaselevel='final', serial=0)

Your python code can not import any modules of it's own, but it does have the following imports
prepended, and not included in the 2048 bytes character limit. .


import math, numpy, scipy, cmath, decimal, fractions, random, statistics, itertools


The code you send can not have an import statement, so if you're testing python code, be sure to 
remove the "import" statement before submission.
