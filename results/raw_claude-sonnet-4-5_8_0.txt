{'reasoning': "I need to find a polynomial function f(x,y) where f(x,y) > 0 gives '#' and f(x,y) <= 0 gives '.'. Let me analyze the pattern:\n\nRow 0: ### (x=0,1,2 are #, x=3,4,5,6,7 are .)\nRow 1: ## (x=0,1 are #, x=2,3,4,5,6,7 are .)\nRow 2: ## (x=0,1 are #, x=2,3,4,5,6,7 are .)\nRow 3: ### (x=0,1,2 are #, x=3,4,5,6,7 are .)\nRow 4: #### (x=0,1,2,3 are #, x=4,5,6,7 are .)\nRow 5: ##### (x=0,1,2,3,4 are #, x=5,6,7 are .)\nRow 6: ####### (x=0,1,2,3,4,5,6 are #, x=7 is .)\nRow 7: ######## (all x are #)\n\nThe boundary seems to follow a curved pattern. Let me identify the boundary points:\n- y=0: boundary around x=3\n- y=1: boundary around x=2\n- y=2: boundary around x=2\n- y=3: boundary around x=3\n- y=4: boundary around x=4\n- y=5: boundary around x=5\n- y=6: boundary around x=7\n- y=7: boundary around x=8 (all filled)\n\nThis looks like it could be approximated by a parabola or similar curve. The boundary approximately follows: x ≈ 2 + 0.5*y for small y, then accelerates.\n\nTrying a polynomial like: x - (some function of y) <= 0 for '#'\nSo f(x,y) = -(x - boundary(y))\n\nLet me try: f(x,y) = -x + 2 + 0.1*y**2 + 0.3*y\n\nTesting some points and refining to match the pattern better.", 'function': 'def f(x, y):\n    return 2 + y**2 / 10 + y / 3 - x'}
