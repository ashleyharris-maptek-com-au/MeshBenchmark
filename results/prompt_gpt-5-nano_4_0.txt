Here is the points and faces of a regular tetrahedron with all sides equal 1, resting on the Z=0 plane and with an edge along the X=0 plane:

polyhedron(
    points = [
        [0, 0, 0],                               // 0
        [1, 0, 0],                               // 1
        [0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0],                     // 2
        [0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(2/3)]              // 3 (apex)
    ],
    faces = [
        [0, 2, 1],   // base (oriented outward)
        [0, 1, 3],
        [1, 2, 3],
        [2, 0, 3]
    ],
    convexity = 4
);

We define a 7-part rigid transform of (x,y,z,q0,q1,q2,q3), where q0,q1,q2,q3 is a normalised quaternion, and x, y, z are the translation.
Rotation is defined around the 0,0,0 point (Which is NOT THE CENTRE), and is performed before translation.

We create a scene with mulitple tetrahedra, each with a different transform. Return the transforms of such a scene
such that a shadow projected vertically (onto the Z=0 plane) fully covers a square of side length 4, centered at the origin.

Use as many tetrahedra as you need, scoring is based on shadow coverage, not the number of tetrahedra used.

Score will be deducted for any shadow outside of the square, for reduntant tetrahedra, or non-normalised quaternions.
