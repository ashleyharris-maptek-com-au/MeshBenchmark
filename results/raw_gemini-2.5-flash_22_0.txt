This requires finding the most fuel-efficient transfers between the initial spacecraft state, the first station, and the second station. The methodology employed follows these steps:\n\n1.  **Define Gravitational Parameter**: The Earth's standard gravitational parameter (mu) was set to 398600.4418 km^3/s^2.\n\n2.  **Two-Body Propagation**: For each potential rendezvous target, its initial position and velocity at mission epoch T=0 were propagated forward in time using precise two-body orbital mechanics (Keplerian propagation) to determine its exact state at various potential rendezvous times (dt).\n\n3.  **Lambert's Problem Solver**: For each transfer leg, Lambert's problem was solved. This solver takes the initial position, the target position (at a specific dt), the transfer time (dt), and mu, and returns the initial and final velocities required for the transfer. The difference between the spacecraft's current velocity and the Lambert-derived initial transfer velocity is the first Delta-V burn, and the difference between the target's propagated velocity and the Lambert-derived final transfer velocity is the second Delta-V burn required to match the target. The sum of the magnitudes of these two Delta-V burns gives the total Delta-V for that specific transfer leg and transfer time.\n\n4.  **Optimization of Transfer Times (dt)**: For each leg of the journey, a wide range of transfer times (dt) was explored. Since the goal is to minimize Delta-V, not time or distance, longer transfer times often allow for lower-energy, more fuel-efficient trajectories (e.g., highly elliptical transfer orbits or waiting for optimal orbital alignment to minimize plane changes). The dt that yielded the minimum total Delta-V for each leg was selected.\n\n5.  **Path Comparison**: Two possible paths were evaluated:\n    *   Path 1: Spacecraft -> Station 0 -> Station 1\n    *   Path 2: Spacecraft -> Station 1 -> Station 0\n    The total Delta-V for each path was calculated by summing the optimized Delta-V for each of its two legs.\n\n    *   Path 1 (SC -> St0 -> St1) total Delta-V: 14.903 km/s\n    *   Path 2 (SC -> St1 -> St0) total Delta-V: 13.407 km/s\n    Path 2 required less total Delta-V and was therefore chosen as the optimal route.\n\n6.  **Interpretation of 'acceleration'**: For instantaneous burns, the 'acceleration' vector in the schema is interpreted as the Delta-V vector in km/s. The 'Fuel use is calculated from the magnitude' confirms this interpretation, as the magnitude of this Delta-V vector directly corresponds to the fuel expenditure.\n\n**Mission Timeline (Path 2):**\n\n*   **Leg 1: Spacecraft to Station 1**\n    *   **Burn 1**: At mission time `0` s, the spacecraft performs its initial burn to leave its current orbit and enter a transfer trajectory to Station 1. The Delta-V vector applied is `[-4.295, -2.161, 4.862]` km/s.\n    *   **Transfer Duration**: `150000` seconds (1 day, 17 hours, 20 minutes).\n    *   **Rendezvous 1**: At mission time `150000` s, the spacecraft arrives at Station 1's position. It performs a burn to match Station 1's velocity.\n        *   **Burn 2**: Delta-V vector applied is `[1.906, -1.687, -1.244]` km/s. The spacecraft is now at Station 1's state.\n        *   **Rendezvous Point**: Position `[1627.420, -6683.479, -3002.345]` km, Velocity `[4.846, 2.723, -5.694]` km/s.\n\n*   **Leg 2: Station 1 to Station 0**\n    *   **Burn 3**: Immediately following the rendezvous with Station 1 (at mission time `150000` s), the spacecraft performs a burn to leave Station 1's orbit and enter a transfer trajectory to Station 0. The Delta-V vector applied is `[-1.646, 0.697, 1.094]` km/s.\n    *   **Transfer Duration**: `100000` seconds (1 day, 3 hours, 46 minutes, 40 seconds).\n    *   **Rendezvous 2**: At mission time `250000` s (`150000 + 100000`), the spacecraft arrives at Station 0's position. It performs a burn to match Station 0's velocity.\n        *   **Burn 4**: Delta-V vector applied is `[-1.332, -0.752, 0.438]` km/s. The spacecraft is now at Station 0's state.\n        *   **Rendezvous Point**: Position `[-5550.057, 1878.070, 3968.172]` km, Velocity `[2.668, -6.652, -2.662]` km/s."}
