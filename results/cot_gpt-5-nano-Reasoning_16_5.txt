**Calculating total volume**

I'm computing volumes for different dimensions: 5x3x2 equals 30, 7x5x3 equals 105, and so on, finishing with 19x17x13 for 4199. After verifying, I find the volumes are 30, 105, 385, 1001, 2431, and 4199. The total volume calculation involves several steps. Ultimately, I arrive at a total volume of 166,153 cubic units. The problem requires the minimum volume container's coordinates for packing, so I need to prepare to list these in 3D.**Structuring bounding box coordinates**

The task involves producing a structured response with an array of boxes, where each has min and max coordinates. I need to decide the dimensions and placement of the bounding box, starting from the origin at (0,0,0). The goal is to find a near-minimal volume for the bounding box while packing prisms efficiently. This could be tricky! A good strategy might be to group by prism types and place them in layers, or perhaps keep them in a single row along the x-axis to minimize gaps.**Optimizing prism arrangement**

To efficiently fit the prisms, I’m considering rotating them to maximize their smaller dimensions along height and depth. For each prism with dimensions (a,b,c), I'll sort them in descending order. I can place the largest dimension along the x-axis, which should help create a bounding length. However, packing them in a grid could be more approachable. I'll provide coordinates for a reasonable packing arrangement, even if it's not perfectly volume-minimizing, and clarify that this may not be the optimal solution.**Developing a packing strategy**

I’m considering a plan to pack the prisms into a container with dimensions that sum the maximum lengths along the x-axis. However, overlaps between heights and depths could complicate matters. Instead, I might arrange the prisms in layers along the z-axis, creating layers based on the largest rotated dimension. I could also suggest a 3D bin packing solver for better precision, but since I can't run code, I can approximate a plausible coordinate layout that avoids overlaps and fits within the bounding box.**Exploring packing strategies**

I’m analyzing various ways to pack 90 prisms into a bounding box. If I place them in a single row, the dimensions could be too tall, so I might stack layers along the z-axis instead. Aligning prisms by their largest dimensions could help, but it complicates the arrangement. The challenge is to create a bounding box that can accommodate all shapes. A cube with dimensions around 55x55x55 seems plausible, but proving the perfect fit is difficult. I can suggest using an approximation method for coordinates while reiterating that I can't guarantee the optimal solution.**Constructing a packing layout**

I’m considering how to pack all the boxes by orienting them with their bases as the two smaller dimensions, resulting in footprints like 3x2, 5x3, etc. To avoid overlaps, I could arrange them side by side and create stacks along the z-axis. However, managing the height dimension gets complicated with various sizes. The total footprint area is 9,771 square units, which gives a rough minimum for the bounding box dimensions. I'm realizing this optimization challenge is complex, so it may be best to propose a heuristic solution for the coordinates, while acknowledging I can’t guarantee optimal packing.**Calculating bounding dimensions**

I’m trying to figure out how to pack the prisms along the x-axis by orienting each with their largest dimension as the length. The total length along x becomes 1236 after calculating each dimension's contribution. The widths for y and z will then depend on the middle and smallest dimensions from each prism type. I realized that, by stacking them in a row, I can set y and z coordinates to fixed values to avoid overlaps. The bounding box dimensions should be determined by the total length along x and the maximum dimensions across y and z from the prisms.**Evaluating box arrangements**

I'm figuring out how to arrange the boxes by placing the largest dimension along x while minimizing the maximum dimensions in y and z. Since they can all share y and z coordinates, we can avoid overlaps if we stack everything along x. The maximum y would be 13, and z would be 17, leading to a bounding box with dimensions of 1236x13x17. However, the volume calculated is 273k, which is more than the total volume needed. I should explore ways to optimize this layout further!**Considering packing strategies**

I’m thinking about how to approach the user's request for a near-optimal packing solution for the boxes. I could implement a 2D shelf packing within a 13x17 cross-section, aligning the boxes based on their sizes. However, since that would require many blocks, I might simplify by creating layers along y. For this arrangement, boxes would be packed in a row along the x-axis while keeping track of their coordinates. I'll prepare to enumerate the coordinates for all 90 boxes involved, ensuring I represent their dimensions accurately!**Structuring box coordinates**

I’m laying out the details for the box coordinates based on their specified orientations. For each box type, I’ll compute the minimum and maximum coordinates while maintaining the current x position. I’ll start each box at the cumulative coordinates and keep updating the current x value. 

Once I complete all 90 boxes with their min and max values, I need to format everything into a structured JSON response, ensuring numbers are integers. This will represent a straightforward greedy packing, not necessarily optimal, but it aligns with the user's request!**Preparing final response**

I’m laying out the final details for the box coordinates, ensuring that each coordinate is an integer. I need to emphasize that this was a straightforward greedy packing, with all boxes oriented to maximize the length along the x-axis. The final bounding box will be X length 1236, Y 13, and Z 17. Now I’ll format everything into a structured JSON response, which includes the "boxes" array for the packing while noting that it’s a valid packing but not necessarily optimal. Let's finalize this!
