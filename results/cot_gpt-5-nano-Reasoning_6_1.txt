**Clarifying voxel projections**

I’m exploring how projections work with the 3D coordinate system. For each (x,z) pair, there's a corresponding y, and similarly for (y,z) pairs with x. Since the grid is finite, I need the projections along all axes to cover the entire range of coordinates from 0 to 7. There shouldn’t be any trivial symmetries, meaning no rotations or reflections that leave the shape unchanged—only the identity transformation is allowed. I want to create a set of 100 voxels that fits this criteria.**Designing voxel structure**

I need to create a JSON-like structure with a voxel array containing objects that have xyz arrays. My goal is to design a 3D pattern with 100 total voxels, within an 8x8x8 grid that has 512 voxels. To ensure every (x,y) pair is covered in projections, I realize we actually need at least 64 voxels. Each voxel contributes to only one pair per projection, meaning I have to ensure that for every combination of coordinates, there's a voxel present. It’s tricky, but I’m hoping to meet these constraints effectively.**Exploring voxel coverage**

I think 100 voxels should be sufficient, but I need to make sure I cover all pairs across the three coordinate planes. One idea is to create a union of "lines" along the z-axis for each (x,y) pair by choosing z=0 or 1, but that could leave holes in the xz and yz projections. To ensure coverage in those pairs, I might need to rethink my strategy. Perhaps a 4x4x4 checker pattern could work, or I could use an 8x8x8 binary array to ensure all projections are properly covered.**Creating a universal voxel pattern**

I'm considering a universal approach to fill an 8x8x8 pattern along all three axes using a Latin-like arrangement. For each (x,y) pair, I can set the voxel at z = (x+y) mod 8, which should ensure coverage for XY pairs. Regarding projections onto xz, I can derive a corresponding y from z and x that always exists.

However, I realize that this method yields a total of 64 voxels, not 100. Still, with these 64 voxels, I can achieve complete projections for both XY and xz.**Assessing voxel symmetry and coverage**

For the projections onto the xz and yz planes, I can derive y from z and x, ensuring each z has a corresponding y. The set S of all (x,y,z) with z ≡ x+y mod 8 indeed has 64 voxels, but the task requires 100. I worry about potential symmetries. After analyzing rotations and reflections, it looks like the only invariant condition is the identity. 

To add 36 voxels without introducing symmetry, I’ll choose asymmetric coordinates to maintain coverage across projections. I need to confirm that the additional voxels won't create new holes and that all projections remain solid.**Generating unique voxel coordinates**

I’m starting with 64 base voxels based on the equation z ≡ x + y mod 8, covering all (x,y) pairs. With these base coordinates, any (x,z) needs a corresponding y, which I’ve confirmed exists. Now, I have to add 36 extra coordinates without mimicking symmetry from the base set.

While constructing the extra coordinates, I’ll ensure they’re scattered enough to avoid symmetry. I’ll double-check to make sure none of these extras overlap with the base remains viable and distinct. Let’s finalize this set of coordinates!**Finalizing voxel coordinates**

I’m checking potential duplicates for the 36 extra coordinates to ensure they don’t conflict with the base set. A couple of entries repeated or matched the base set, which I corrected. I swapped out one for a new coordinate. Now I've got 100 unique voxel coordinates total! Each coordinate is carefully chosen to avoid symmetry, thereby preserving the integrity of the set. Next, I’ll format these into a JSON-like structure for the final output. Let's do this!**Compiling voxel coordinates**

I've set the 36th entry to (4,0,2), replacing (3,5,0), ensuring no duplicates are present in my extras. Now I’ll list out the first 64 base coordinates and then the 36 extras in order. It looks like I need to make sure that all coordinates remain within valid bounds. Once I have everything neatly organized, I’ll format it as a JSON object called "voxels," which will include an array of my coordinates without any trailing commas or errors to ensure clarity. Let's get this structured!**Building voxel sequences**

I'm working on organizing the voxel coordinates from 1 to 64 for each base x-value first, which covers x=0 to x=7. Then I’m adding extras from 65 to 100. It looks like I need to make sure there are no duplicates and confirm that the last added coordinate, (4,0,2), is indeed included! Finally, I'll format everything as a JSON object without any extra commentary or trailing commas. Let’s finalize that JSON content properly!
