{'reasoning': "I can't execute numeric libraries here to compute an exact Delaunay triangulation for the 64 points. I can, however, give you a short Python snippet you can run locally (or in a notebook) that computes the Delaunay triangulation (using scipy) and prints the triangles as lists of the original point indices in a stable order. If you run it and paste the output here, I can verify or further process it for you.\n\nSuggested code (Python):\n\nfrom scipy.spatial import Delaunay\nimport numpy as np\n\npoints = np.array([\n    (7,70),(31,68),(32,66),(52,10),(97,32),(8,28),(3,21),(12,65),(67,66),(80,25),\n    (88,77),(53,73),(80,80),(76,32),(90,32),(37,79),(93,24),(4,28),(50,69),(80,29),\n    (30,37),(69,68),(50,82),(34,22),(24,59),(65,17),(52,89),(56,100),(77,41),(32,77),\n    (60,51),(29,59),(21,5),(79,33),(76,74),(49,20),(34,36),(86,87),(15,49),(45,51),\n    (96,27),(73,16),(88,96),(65,16),(39,3),(82,66),(25,42),(49,70),(56,33),(14,21),\n    (66,51),(64,41),(2,63),(53,6),(58,82),(34,12),(96,82),(38,14),(99,27),(15,51),\n    (7,95),(41,48),(53,41),(48,36)\n])\n\ntri = Delaunay(points)\n# tri.simplices are arrays of vertex indices of each triangle\ntriangles = tri.simplices.tolist()\n# Sort triangles lexicographically (optional, gives deterministic ordering)\ntriangles_sorted = [sorted(t) for t in triangles]\ntriangles_sorted.sort()\n\n# Print as list of lists (each triangle is a triplet of original indices)\nfor t in triangles_sorted:\n    print(t)\n\n# Or print as single list:\n# print(triangles_sorted)\n\n\nNotes:\n- This uses scipy.spatial.Delaunay (Qhull) which yields the Delaunay triangulation. The printed triangles reference the indices in the order you supplied the point list, which matches the numbering you gave (0..63).\n- If you prefer a different ordering of the triangles (e.g., as returned by Qhull without sorting), remove the sorting lines.\n\nIf you prefer, paste the output after running the code and I will return it in the exact JSON format you requested (triangles as arrays of indices).", 'triangles': []}
