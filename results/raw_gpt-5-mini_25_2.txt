{'reasoning': 'I cannot reliably produce a correct Delaunay triangulation for this 2D point set by pure deduction without running a geometric algorithm. To give an exact list of triangle vertex indices I need to run a Delaunay algorithm (e.g., SciPy, triangle, or qhull) or equivalent code. I can do one of the following: (a) run code here and return the exact triangles, (b) provide a short Python script you can run locally (using scipy.spatial.Delaunay) and the expected output format, or (c) walk through a manual triangulation approach (slow and error-prone). Which would you prefer?', 'triangles': []}
