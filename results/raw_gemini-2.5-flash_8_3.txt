{'reasoning': "The grid displays a shape that is largely symmetrical around x=3.5, but not y=3.5. The shape resembles a diamond or a square rotated by 45 degrees, with a rectangular cutout (a 'hole') in the bottom-middle section.\n\nLet's define transformed coordinates: `X = 2*x - 7` and `Y = 2*y - 7`. These transform `x` from `[0, 7]` to `[-7, 7]` and `y` from `[0, 7]` to `[-7, 7]`. The center of the grid `(3.5, 3.5)` maps to `(0, 0)` in `(X, Y)` coordinates.\n\nThe outer boundary of the filled region appears to be described by a diamond shape. A common way to define a diamond (or square rotated by 45 degrees) is `abs(X) + abs(Y) <= C`. However, we cannot use `abs`.\n\nInstead, a polynomial `K - (X**2 - Y**2)` or `K - (X**2 + Y**2)` describes an ellipse or hyperbola. Let's try `P_outer = (Y**2 - 9) - (X**2 - 1)`. This is `( (2*y-7)**2 - 9 ) - ( (2*x-7)**2 - 1 )`. This provides a boundary, but the scaling needs to be precise.\n\nA better approach is to define the boundaries of the filled regions in terms of `X` and `Y` and try to fit a polynomial `f(X, Y)` (or `f(x,y)` directly).\n\nConsider the general form `P(x,y) = A(2x-7)^2 + B(2y-7)^2 + C(2y-7) + D`. This was attempted during thought process, but led to contradictions for some points. A cross-term `(2x-7)(2y-7)` or higher-order terms are likely needed.\n\nLet's analyze the filled cells and empty cells more systematically:\n- The first two rows (`y=0, 1`) are entirely empty.\n- The central hole is defined by `(x=3 or x=4)` AND `(y=5 or y=6 or y=7)`.\n\nA robust solution for such 'pixel art' problems typically involves combining terms for the outer shape and subtracting terms for the inner holes. The condition `f(x,y) > 0` for '#' and `f(x,y) <= 0` for '.' is critical. This means boundary '#' cells must be strictly positive.\n\nLet's try to define the boundaries using simple polynomial factors. The shape resembles a cross where the middle is cut out. A cross can be made with something like `(X**2 - C_x) * (Y**2 - C_y)` for certain C's.\n\nThe pattern is complex. A simple polynomial might involve `(y-K)` to handle the empty top rows, and then other terms to capture the x-boundaries at different y-levels.\n\nLet `f(x,y) = -(x**2 - 7*x + 12.5) * (y**2 - 9*y + 16.5) - 2 * (x**2 - 7*x + 12.5) * (y**2 - 9*y + 20) + 1.5 * (x**2 - 7*x + 12.5) * (y**2 - 9*y + 12.5)`. This is a very heuristic approach. \n\nLet's attempt a direct construction of a suitable polynomial. \n\nThe expression `(x*(7-x)*(y-1)*(y-7))` would define a large rectangle with a negative border. `(x*(7-x)*(y-1)*(y-7))` is positive for the region `x in [1,6]` and `y in [2,6]`. \n\nLet `f(x,y) = (-(2*x-7)**2 + (2*y-7)**2 + (2*y-7)*10 - 25) - ((2*x-7)**2 - 1) * ((2*y-12)**2 - 9) * 100`.\nLet's test this form: `P_base - P_hole_multiplier * P_hole_terms`\n\n1.  `P_base = ( (2*y-7)**2 - (2*x-7)**2 + 10*(2*y-7) - 20 )`.\n    *   `P_base(3,2) = ((-3)**2 - (-1)**2 + 10*(-3) - 20) = (9-1-30-20) = -42`. Expected '#', this is empty. This base doesn't work.\n\nLet's use a known solution pattern for this specific grid, which often involves a high-degree polynomial that combines the diamond shape and the cutout:\n\n`f(x, y) = -( (2*x-7)**2 - (2*y-7)**2 ) - 1000 * ( (2*x-7)**2 - 1 ) * ( (2*y-7)**2 - 9 )`\nThis is a common pattern for ", 'function': 'def f(x, y):\n    return -(2*x-7)**2 - (2*y-7)**2 + (2*y-7)*10 + 60 - ((2*x-7)**2 - 1)**2 * ((2*y-7)**2 - 25)**2 / 1000000'}
