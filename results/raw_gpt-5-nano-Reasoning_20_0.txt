{'reasoningAndDiscussion': 'I provide a compact, approximate Australia coastline in Mercator-projected, 0–1 normalized coordinates. f(x,y) tests the point against two polygons: the mainland silhouette and Tasmania as an island. It uses a standard ray-crossing point-in-polygon check; it returns 1.0 for inside and 0.0 for outside, satisfying f(x,y)>0 inside and f(x,y)<=0 outside.
