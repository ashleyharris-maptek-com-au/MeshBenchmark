**Considering sniper visibility**

I'm thinking about whether a sniper at a specific positive coordinate can see the origin or not. If people are behind a building in the direct line-of-sight, the line from the sniper would indeed intersect with the building. Since the sniper is positioned far away, many lines around the building will likely not intersect. To ensure that a person is seen, they should be positioned within what I call the "shadow" of the building from the sniper's viewpoint.**Calculating building intersection**

I'm analyzing the building's shadow at the origin and how it projects onto the ground plane. I need to find the 3D intersection where a line from the sniper to a point near the origin intersects the building. To do this, I consider the direction from the sniper to the ground point and whether it crosses into the designated area. If the parameters give a value of t in the range [0,1], that indicates intersection with the building, taking the coordinates into account as the line moves downward from z=20 to z=0.**Finding intersection criteria**

To determine if the line intersects the building, I need a specific value for t that satisfies the constraints for x, y, and z. The z constraint leads me to conclude that t must fall within [0.5, 1]. Now, at some point t in that range, the x and y coordinates should also be within the bounds of [-2,2].  

I’ll express x and y values in terms of t and the coordinates. If I can solve for these bounds effectively, I could find point P with coordinates that meet the intersection criteria.**Sampling intersection points**

To find sample points that will intersect, I can choose P with coordinates less than -2. If I set x_p to -2, then the value becomes negative, which will help in calculating t. For x_p = -2, I get a range for t that intersects with [0.5,1]. I can do the same for y_p. 

So if P is at (-2, -2), it appears that the line from S to P will intersect the building. I need to double-check calculations regarding z values, especially around t being close to 1.**Placement of bounding boxes**

I'm figuring out how to place 20 bounding boxes near the building without overlapping. Since these boxes must be on the ground (z=0 to z=2) and not within the building footprint (which occupies [-2,2] in both x and y), I need to ensure their bases don't intersect. 

To avoid overlap, I can place the boxes at least 1.75 units away from the building's edges, considering the size of the boxes. This means I need to strategically position them outside the building's footprint to ensure they’re visible from the sniper's line of sight while following the distance constraints.**Determining valid positions for boxes**

I'm working on ensuring that bounding boxes don't overlap with the building and also maintain a line of sight block from S to P. The center of each box must be positioned outside the building's footprint, so I need coordinates fulfilling both x ≤ -2 and y ≤ -2. 

To further refine placement, I'll keep the distance from the building center less than or equal to 30 meters while spacing the boxes at least 0.5 units apart. This way, I can arrange 20 boxes satisfactorily within the designated quadrant and ensure effective line blocking. I'll also maintain the necessary t-values for the line to intersect the building correctly.**Analyzing intersections and intervals**

I'm analyzing the conditions needed for the line from S to P to intersect the building while ensuring that certain inequalities hold. With x_p being quite negative, I see that t1 needs to be at least 0.5, leading me to derive specific requirements for x_p. 

To summarize, I need to verify that x_p exceeds a certain threshold, specifically -104, for t1 to satisfy my earlier calculations. Also, I want to ensure that the intervals for t intersect properly, confirming that both x and y align with the necessary criteria. This precision will keep everything aligned effectively!**Determining positions for bounding boxes**

Alright, I need to ensure that the placement of 20 bounding boxes remains outside the building's footprint while also observing spatial requirements. I found that for any point P in quadrant III, as long as the coordinates are within specified bounds, the line from S will intersect the building.

I’m planning to set the boxes’ centers around a circle with careful angular spacing to avoid overlaps while maintaining sufficient distance from the building. The calculations confirm that with proper positioning, I can achieve non-overlapping placements safely. I need everything to align for effectiveness!**Calculating coordinates for quadrant III**

To position 20 points in quadrant III across a 90° arc, I'm using angles from 180° to 270° with increments of about 4.74°. This ensures they stay within the right area and avoids overlaps with the building. 

I'll compute their coordinates using equations involving cosine and sine for these angles while ensuring the distance remains within the required limits. If I choose a radius of 22, the calculations should yield non-overlapping positions that meet all specified conditions!**Evaluating points' coordinates**

I'm calculating coordinates for points spread across a 90° arc in quadrant III. For each angle, I compute the cosine and sine values to find the x and y coordinates. As I get to 270°, I make note that this position is still within quadrant III, ensuring all points remain behind the building. 

I want to check if the line of sight intersects the building. The intervals for both x and y must allow simultaneous crossing to confirm this. It’s essential to verify all calculations to ensure everything meets the conditions!**Examining line of sight intersections**

I'm checking the intervals for t values where both x and y coordinates can fall within the range of [-2,2]. It turns out that for certain P points, it’s impossible to find a t that meets both x and y constraints, meaning the line might not intersect the building as previously thought. 

To avoid overlaps with the building, I'll ensure that my chosen points have coordinates that satisfy |x| and |y| being greater than 2.25. This helps maintain a safe distance and ensures proper visibility!**Determining point placement for intersection avoidance**

I'm analyzing the angles near 270° to see how they affect the coordinates. With y around -18, there's no overlap with the building's footprint due to y being significantly negative. However, the x coordinate is close to -0.16, putting it within the building's range. 

To ensure visibility and avoid overlap, it looks like I need to maintain both x and y coordinates beneath -2. This ensures sufficient separation while keeping the points in quadrant III, so they stay clear of the axes!**Selecting angles and radius for positioning**

I’m beginning with an angle close to 180°, but I need to ensure that as I adjust my angles from 184° to 270°, the y-coordinate remains below -2. Starting at an r of 25 works well as it results in necessary negative y-values. 

Just to be thorough, I want to ensure there's no overlap with the building dimensions; I’ll generate points from 184.7368° to 270° while keeping both coordinates sufficiently beyond -2. So 20 calculated points should keep everything safely spaced!**Calculating coordinates with angles**

I’ll be presenting approximate coordinates to two decimals. For the calculations, I’m producing values for angles from 0 to 19. 

Starting with θ0 at 184.7368°, I compute positions using sin and cos functions. Continuing this through each angle, I ensure that they stay below specified thresholds. I note that adding angles beyond 270° brings in complications. 

To keep things safe, I need to make sure to avoid angles exceeding 270° to prevent any potential overlaps with the building boundaries.**Positioning people safely**

I'm choosing angles for 20 points across an arc, avoiding direct lines of sight from the sniper. Instead of including the last angle exactly at 270°, I'll use evenly spaced angles between 185° and 270°, ensuring they stay behind the building. 

To avoid overlaps, I’ll separate each position by at least 0.5 units, creating a radius of 25 m. The calculations ensure that angles do not produce any overlaps or lines of sight. I'll finalize the structured response with the approximate coordinates for these positions.**Calculating positions for coverage**

I’m deciding to place points along a diagonal line around 225°, ensuring line-of-sight is blocked. Spreading angles from 205° to 245° should work, where x and y coordinates have similar magnitudes. 

I'll calculate 20 evenly spaced points using a radius of 25 m, ensuring their distances avoid overlap. For each angle, I’ll compute the corresponding x and y values based on cosine and sine functions, then summarize these coordinates clearly. This way, all positions maintain coverage from the sniper's view behind the building.**Calculating coordinates for points**

I'm working on approximating values for cosine and sine for various angles (δ). For each δ, I'll compute cos θ and sin θ, yielding coordinates x and y. 

I'm taking careful steps to use small-angle approximations as needed and ensure all calculations line up correctly. I aim to summarize and organize these computed points neatly, keeping it clear and precise so I can reference them effectively later on. This will help create accurate placements with the desired conditions.**Refining coordinate calculations**

It looks like I'm reviewing the y-value for i3, noticing it doesn't seem to fit the expected pattern due to the progression of δ. Consistency is key, so I'll check the previous coordinates and see that i3's value is not matching up with earlier data.

I want to recalculate and ensure all values reflect the desired separation. The main goal is to present 20 approximate coordinates without overlaps, ensuring they all remain within acceptable bounds while adjusting the calculations for consistency across the board. I'll verify all computations using the adjusted formulas.**Calculating trigonometric values**

I'm diving into calculating values for various δ, specifically focusing on their cosine and sine. For instance, I confirmed that cos 9.47° is about 0.9862, while sin δ is around -0.1648. I’ll continue calculating these values step by step to ensure accuracy.

Now, I’ll compute cos θ and sin θ using the formula. For each δ value, I'll adjust the computations based on the positive or negative value of sin δ, making sure that I carefully derive each coordinate based on these approximations.**Computing coordinates**

I'm working through coordinates based on δ values, calculating z for cosine and sine. For instance, for δ = -11.58, I find cos ≈ 0.980 and sin ≈ -0.200. That leads to the x and y values resulting in changes that seem consistent within the needed range. 

I’m verifying that all x values fall below -10, ensuring they won't overlap with any buildings. The calculations look good for a set of 20 points around a circle of radius 25.**Verifying line of sight**

I’m checking the line-of-sight blocking for coordinates where x and y both fall between -22 and -10. It looks like the distance calculations confirm the line is blocked. The 3D distance from the building center to the person is around 25.319, which is under 30. I’ll summarize by crafting a structured JSON output, focusing solely on the required coordinates without including unnecessary details. The final output includes 20 pairs of x and y values, maintaining the required format accurately. Here it goes!

I see the provided schema indicates the root object needs to have "people" as a property, without needing to include "type" or "required." So, I should structure my output to match precisely, making sure to include each coordinate under "xy" according to the specified order. I’ll provide the coordinates while noting that lines of sight are blocked, although the instructions don't require it. I’ll focus on delivering the final JSON output correctly.
