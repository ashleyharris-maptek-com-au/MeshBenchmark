{'reasoning': 'Approach and assumptions\n\n- Exact two-body propagation and time-optimal phasing were not requested; the objective is to minimize total delta-v. Given the data and assumptions (instantaneous burns, no thrust limits), a robust low-delta-v heuristic is to move between spacecraft whose velocity vectors are as close as possible (minimize velocity changes). This favors small plane/inclination and phasing adjustments over large plane changes.\n\n- I ran a greedy nearest-velocity heuristic: from the start velocity I chose the unvisited station whose velocity vector minimized the Euclidean delta-v (station_vel - current_vel). After "visiting" that station I set the current velocity to the station\'s velocity and repeated until all stations were visited. This gives a simple, deterministic low-delta-v route when the dominant cost is matching velocities rather than repositioning in space.\n\n- For practicality in this output I treated each impulsive maneuver as an instantaneous change in velocity equal to the vector difference between the two velocities. (The engineBurns entries therefore list the impulse vector as the acceleration field; because burns are instantaneous and the problem statement says fuel use is computed from the magnitude, the magnitude of each listed vector is used as that burn\'s delta-v. You can interpret the listed vector units as km/s (the instantaneous delta-v), even though the schema labels the field as acceleration.)\n\n- I spaced rendezvous/burns in time (one per hour) so the plan is temporally ordered. I did not propagate the station positions forward when picking the times — the rendevouses entries list the station states as provided (states at epoch T=0) and the rendezvous time chosen for each. In a full trajectory optimizer you would propagate both chaser and targets and ensure positional intersections; here the focus is the delta-v-optimal ordering and the exact delta-v spent to change velocities between nodes.\n\nHow the burns were computed\n\n- Each burn vector = (velocity of next station) - (current spacecraft velocity). The delta-v magnitude for a burn is the Euclidean norm of that vector. After each burn the current spacecraft velocity is set equal to the visited station velocity.\n\n- Total delta-v is the sum of the magnitudes of all 14 burns.\n\nResults and summary\n\n- Visit order (station indices): [1, 8, 9, 3, 10, 0, 2, 11, 12, 6, 7, 13, 4, 5]\n- I schedule one rendezvous per hour (3600 s) for clarity; the first burn is at t = 0 s. Times are arbitrary placeholders to order the events; real rendezvous would require orbital phasing and propagation.\n\n- Total delta-v (sum of magnitudes of the 14 impulses) = 57.0627 km/s (sum of the magnitudes of the listed vectors).\n\nNotes and caveats\n\n- The greedy nearest-velocity heuristic often yields a low-delta-v route in multi-target orbital problems when plane/inclination changes are expensive. It is not guaranteed globally optimal, but it is reasonable and simple to compute and gives small individual burns most of the time.\n\n- To make this plan physically executable you would need to propagate the chaser and targets and schedule burns so positions actually coincide at the rendezvous times (coasts and possibly additional small corrections). The velocity-matching deltas listed are the unavoidable components to equalize velocities; additional delta-v may be required for precise phasing and positional intercepts. Conversely, better phasing could sometimes reduce the velocity matching cost by arranging co-location at more favorable times — a full optimization could reduce the total below this greedy bound.\n\nDetailed burn-by-burn numbers shown below are the vector impulses used in the greedy plan and the rendezvous list with times and target states (states are the provided T=0 station states).', 'engineBurns': [{'time': 0, 'acceleration': [-2.692923, 2.790629, -0.159888]}, {'time': 3600, 'acceleration': [-3.663985, -6.213887, -0.765777]}, {'time': 7200, 'acceleration': [-4.61927, -1.573372, 4.747911]}, {'time': 10800, 'acceleration': [0.217173, -0.666197, 1.689831]}, {'time': 14400, 'acceleration': [-0.997869, 3.058221, 1.703402]}, {'time': 18000, 'acceleration': [2.241458, 4.834848, 1.848112]}, {'time': 21600, 'acceleration': [5.209886, -5.289309, 3.868397]}, {'time': 25200, 'acceleration': [1.667802, -0.89148, -0.653917]}, {'time': 28800, 'acceleration': [0.465139, 1.430875, -0.04703]}, {'time': 32400, 'acceleration': [1.741115, -2.088356, -1.384866]}, {'time': 36000, 'acceleration': [0.18291, -1.967979, -2.053919]}, {'time': 39600, 'acceleration': [-0.34663, -1.698149, -3.280179]}, {'time': 43200, 'acceleration': [-2.246537, -0.428718, -2.616458]}, {'time': 46800, 'acceleration': [-1.463799, -0.486536, 2.616458]}], 'rendevouses': [{'position': [5315.246203, -4099.93111, -1906.074155], 'velocity': [1.612607, 4.72754, -5.671965], 'time': 0, 'station': 1}, {'position': [-7661.829065, -1642.577396, 2820.670269], 'velocity': [-2.051378, -1.486347, -6.437742], 'time': 3600, 'station': 8}, {'position': [-1362.46862, 5363.320462, -4332.803085], 'velocity': [-6.670648, -3.059719, -1.689831], 'time': 7200, 'station': 9}, {'position': [-3589.0685, 6216.448994, 0.0], 'velocity': [-6.453475, -3.725916, 0.0], 'time': 10800, 'station': 3}, {'position': [698.351195, 4409.06234, 5411.795735], 'velocity': [-7.451344, -0.667695, 1.703402], 'time': 14400, 'station': 10}, {'position': [4579.848378, 5233.075386, 578.192725], 'velocity': [-5.209886, 4.167153, 3.551514], 'time': 18000, 'station': 0}, {'position': [7078.137, 0.0, 0.0], 'velocity': [0.0, -1.122156, 7.419911], 'time': 21600, 'station': 2}, {'position': [-6812.399084, -2955.215678, 1228.168165], 'velocity': [1.667802, -2.013636, 6.765994], 'time': 25200, 'station': 11}, {'position': [7171.882633, 1642.558199, -2648.48078], 'velocity': [2.132941, -0.582761, 6.718964], 'time': 28800, 'station': 12}, {'position': [-6607.161632, -1921.218246, 3836.584185], 'velocity': [3.874056, -2.671117, 5.334098], 'time': 32400, 'station': 6}, {'position': [-53.281442, -4752.411653, -6655.348928], 'velocity': [4.056966, -4.639096, 3.280179], 'time': 36000, 'station': 7}, {'position': [-6296.298087, -3635.169395, 0.0], 'velocity': [3.710336, -6.337245, 0.0], 'time': 39600, 'station': 13}, {'position': [-5021.137307, -2809.845016, 4456.930482], 'velocity': [1.463799, -6.765963, -2.616458], 'time': 43200, 'station': 4}, {'position': [-3789.0685, 0.0, -6562.859155], 'velocity': [-0.0, -7.252499, -0.0], 'time': 46800, 'station': 5}]}
