{'reasoning': "Crossbar (Pipe 1) is at the origin, oriented horizontally. The remaining four pipes form two vertical legs, each made of two pipes stacked end-to-end to reach 10 m height. Place left leg at x = -2.5 m with centers at y = -2.5 m and y = 2.5 m; place right leg at x = 2.5 m with centers at y = -2.5 m and y = 2.5 m. All four vertical pipes are rotated 90° to be vertical. This yields an overall 10 m tall 'H' with end-to-end contacts at (±2.5, 0) and no pipe intersections elsewhere.", 'pipes': [{'xCentre': 0, 'yCentre': 0, 'rotationDegrees': 0}, {'xCentre': -2.5, 'yCentre': -2.5, 'rotationDegrees': 90}, {'xCentre': -2.5, 'yCentre': 2.5, 'rotationDegrees': 90}, {'xCentre': 2.5, 'yCentre': -2.5, 'rotationDegrees': 90}, {'xCentre': 2.5, 'yCentre': 2.5, 'rotationDegrees': 90}]}
