**Analyzing voxel coverage**

I'm thinking about voxel coverage for different planes. Each voxel covers an (x,y) pair, so to fully cover XY, I need 144 voxels, one for each pair. The same goes for XZ, where I'd also need 144 voxels if each (x,z) pair has to account for a specific y. If arranged cleverly, 144 voxels might cover all three projections, but I'd need to make sure that every (x,z) pair has a corresponding voxel with some y. This requires careful analysis to avoid gaps in coverage.**Exploring voxel arrangements**

I'm wondering if for XY coverage, every (x,y) pair needs to have a corresponding z, and similarly for XZ pairs needing a y. With a minimal sum of unique (x,y) pairs at 144, could 200 voxels cover both XY and XZ? I realize I can reuse voxels across planes, and it's theoretically possible if I arrange 144 voxels in a 12x12x12 cube so all coverage requirements are met. But can I guarantee coverage with just 200 voxels? Maybe I could construct a complete grid, although that would take 1728 voxels.**Generating voxel coordinates**

I need to produce coordinates for a voxel arrangement. It's not about the algorithm per se, but I want to ensure there are "no trivial symmetries," meaning no rotational or reflective symmetries that map the set onto itself. To break symmetry, I'll aim for an irregular distribution across the layers. For each (x,y) pair, I could place a voxel at z = (x*y) mod 12, ensuring full XY coverage. But then I need to ensure coverage for each (x,z) and (y,z) pair as well. It might not be straightforward, so there's more to consider!**Evaluating voxel coverage constraints**

I realize that selecting a voxel for every (x,y) pair results in 144 voxels, which is okay since I have 200. However, that doesn’t guarantee coverage for every (x,z) pair. For each x and z, I'd need a voxel corresponding to those values, and with 12 possible y's, the distribution along z can create gaps. To ensure all 144 (x,z) combinations are covered, I would need at least 144 specific voxels for that coverage, which complicates things since I'm limited to the 144 from the XY selection.**Analyzing voxel symmetry**

I'm thinking about how adding a voxel (a,b,c) doesn't break symmetry if its mirror (b,a,c) is already in the set. Since the base set S is closed under reflection, simply adding another voxel won't change that; the reflection will always be present. To actually break the symmetry, I'd need to add a voxel without its mirrored counterpart, but since S includes all pairs, the symmetry remains. Essentially, as long as each voxel's reflection exists in the final set, the symmetry about the x=y plane holds. So adding more voxels won’t disrupt that balance.**Breaking symmetry in voxel arrangements**

I’m realizing that if I start with a symmetric set S under the x<->y reflection and add additional voxels, the overall symmetry remains intact. To break this symmetry, the added voxels need to have their reflections absent from the final set. I can construct a situation where the function defining z is asymmetric, so that for some pairs, z values differ. By ensuring there exists at least one voxel (x,y,z) for which (y,x,z) is not included, I can effectively avoid trivial symmetries and maintain the desired projections.**Designing non-symmetric voxel functions**

To break symmetry in voxel arrangements, I need to choose a non-symmetric function f such that f(y,x) ≠ f(x,y) for at least some pairs where x≠y. By doing this, the reflection of these voxels will not be present in the final set, hence breaking the symmetry. 

I’m looking at functions like f(x,y) = (x + 2y) mod 12, which ensures the projections fully cover required pairs while avoiding trivial symmetries. For completeness, this function should create a Latin square mapping to confirm full projections on all planes and maintain non-trivial symmetry. That way, each voxel arrangement will be unique and symmetrical only under identity.**Creating a non-symmetric function**

To ensure no symmetrical relationships in my voxel set, I need to define a function f that lacks any permutation symmetries. Using a Latin square, I can choose a function like f(x,y) = (ax + by) mod 12, where a and b are coprime to 12. This guarantees unique permutations for rows and columns. I’ll select a = 1 and b = 5, which simplifies matters.

With these choices, I'll verify there's no symmetry, meaning there’s at least one instance where the swap (x,y) doesn't yield an equal reflection, confirming symmetry is broken effectively.**Defining voxel structure**

I’m verifying the existence of a voxel at (y,x,z), which requires z = f(y,x). If f(y,x) ≠ z, there's no voxel, breaking symmetry. I need to ensure that the Latin square has no nontrivial symmetries, so I’ll select a function f where a ≠ b. For instance, setting f(x,y) = (x + 5y) mod 12 will maintain unique pairings.

I’ll then project 144 voxels and introduce 56 extra ones while ensuring they don’t introduce new symmetries. To maintain this, I'll randomly choose extra voxels while adhering to the predefined structure to guarantee proper formatting for output.**Constructing voxel coordinates**

The user has requested positioning 200 voxels. I realize I need to provide 200 coordinates to satisfy their expectations. My plan is to create a base of 144 coordinates using a specific formula to calculate z based on x and y, then add 56 more unique coordinates without creating symmetry.

I can compute the base coordinates systematically with z = (x + 5y) mod 12 for x and y values ranging from 0 to 11. For the additional coordinates, I’ll select them randomly but ensure they don’t mirror existing ones or introduce symmetry. It’ll be a careful balance!**Designing voxel arrangements**

I need to ensure the extra 56 voxels I’m selecting don’t create symmetry with the existing voxel arrangements. I can develop a pattern, choosing z values while maintaining uniqueness.

I’ll opt for extra coordinates based on pairs like (x, y) from 0 to 3, ensuring z doesn’t equal the output of the primary function. It seems feasible to have multiple voxels aligned on the same (x, y) while varying z. As I select extra voxels, I'll carefully avoid adding any swapped pairs that could create symmetrical structures, maximizing irregularity and breaking potential symmetry issues.**Analyzing voxel symmetry**

I’m focusing on ensuring that the extra 56 voxels I select don’t cause symmetry issues with the existing voxel set. To do this, I'll make sure that for each extra voxel, neither its swapped pairs nor duplicates are present in either the existing set, S, or within the extra ones. 

I have a systematic way to choose these extra voxels by ensuring that z doesn’t equal the output of the function f for each coordinate pair (x,y). I’ll carefully choose coordinates to maintain uniqueness and avoid unintended symmetry.**Avoiding voxel symmetry**

I need to ensure that adding extra voxels won't reintroduce any symmetry in the existing set. To do this, I must make sure that each chosen extra voxel doesn't have its mirrored counterpart in either the base set or the extras themselves. Since there is at least one voxel without a corresponding mirror in the current set, I’ll select coordinates carefully, avoiding any mirrors for the known non-symmetric pairs. This way, I can mostly guarantee that the final set will not possess any reflection symmetry.**Selecting unique voxel extras**

I'm working to ensure that I can add extras without creating symmetry in the set. I plan to propose 56 additional voxels, starting with coordinates along (0,y,z). I want to avoid mirroring any existing voxels, so I need to be careful about the z-values I choose. I’m systematically counting extras while also making sure not to duplicate any entries from the existing set S. It’s a bit tedious, but I’m focused on avoiding symmetry and maintaining uniqueness in the chosen coordinates.**Compiling voxel coordinates**

I'm finalizing the voxel coordinates for the project. I need to ensure that I'm accounting for all the groups systematically, so I've divided them into categories, ensuring there's no duplication while preserving uniqueness. 

I've gathered 144 base coordinates and am now appending 56 extras, each carefully selected to avoid any symmetry or repetition with existing coordinates. Following that, I'll present everything in a structured JSON-like format, which will include each coordinate in the correct order, all formatted neatly for clarity. It’s a meticulous process, but I’m excited to see it all compiled!**Producing voxel structure**

I'm realizing that the problem didn't specify whether to use indexing, but 0-based indexing is common in programming. I should note that my answer should present the coordinates in a structured JSON format. 

I need to adhere to the schema provided, which expects a property "voxels" that contains an array of objects, each with "xyz" as an array of numbers. I'll make sure to assemble all 200 entries correctly — 144 from the base and an extra 56 defined entries without trailing commas. Let's finalize the JSON!
