{'reasoning': 'The task requires identifying all leaf nodes that share a face with any of the 8 corner nodes of the unit cube. The cube is recursively subdivided 15 times according to the sequence of dimensions: Z, X, Y, Z, X, Y, Z, X, Y, Z, X, Y, Z, X, Y. Each dimension (X, Y, Z) is subdivided 5 times in total, meaning each leaf node has an extent of 1/2^5 = 1/32 along each of its primary axes. A node\'s path is a 15-character binary string, where each character \'0\' or \'1\' indicates which half of the current subdivision the node occupies for the dimension being split at that step. \'0\' represents the minimum half, and \'1\' represents the maximum half.\n\n1.  **Identify the 8 corner nodes**: A corner node is defined by occupying the \'0\' or \'1\' (minimum or maximum) subdivision for *all* splits along each of the X, Y, and Z axes. For example, the (0,0,0) corner node means that for every X-split, the \'0\' path is taken; for every Y-split, the \'0\' path is taken; and for every Z-split, the \'0\' path is taken. This applies to all 8 combinations of (0 or 1) for (X,Y,Z). These corner nodes are constructed by segmenting the 15-character path into 5 X-segments, 5 Y-segments, and 5 Z-segments, and making each segment either \'00000\' or \'11111\' based on the corner\'s global coordinate.\n\n2.  **Define face-adjacency**: Two leaf nodes are face-adjacent if they share a common 2-dimensional boundary. This means they are immediately adjacent along one axis (e.g., node A\'s X-max matches node B\'s X-min), and their extents along the other two axes are identical.\n\n3.  **Generate adjacent nodes**: For each corner node `C = (cx, cy, cz)`, there are three face-adjacent neighbors, one along each axis:\n    *   **X-adjacent node**: Shares the Y and Z split patterns with `C`. Its X split pattern will be `"10000"` if `cx=0` (neighbor in positive X direction), or `"01111"` if `cx=1` (neighbor in negative X direction). This pattern ensures adjacency by having the first split in that dimension be the opposite of the corner\'s side, and subsequent splits maintaining alignment with the corner.\n    *   **Y-adjacent node**: Shares the X and Z split patterns with `C`. Its Y split pattern will be `"10000"` if `cy=0`, or `"01111"` if `cy=1`.\n    *   **Z-adjacent node**: Shares the X and Y split patterns with `C`. Its Z split pattern will be `"10000"` if `cz=0`, or `"01111"` if `cz=1`.\n\n4.  **Filter and Sort**: These generated adjacent nodes are distinct from the corner nodes themselves (as their dimensional split patterns are not uniform). There are 8 corner nodes, and each has 3 unique face-adjacent neighbors, resulting in 24 total nodes. These nodes are collected and sorted alphabetically.', 'nodes': ['000000000000000', '001000000000000', '010000000000000', '011001001001001', '011111111111111', '100000000000000', '100100100100100', '101100100100100', '110100100100100', '000100100100100', '001101101101101', '010101101101101', '100101101101101', '101101101101101', '000001001001001', '010001001001001', '100001001001001', '101001001001001', '000010010010010', '001010010010010', '010010010010010', '100010010010010', '110010010010010', '111011011011011', '000011011011011', '001011011011011', '010011011011011', '011011011011011', '100011011011011', '110011011011011', '000110110110110', '010110110110110', '100110110110110', '110110110110110', '111110110110110', '000000110110110', '001000110110110', '010000110110110', '100000110110110', '110000110110110', '000001111111111', '001001111111111', '010001111111111', '100001111111111', '101001111111111', '110001111111111', '111001111111111', '111111111111111']}
