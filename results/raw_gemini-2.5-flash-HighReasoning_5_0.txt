{'reasoning': "Successfully generated a 16x16 maze using a Randomized Prim's algorithm for the structure. This ensures a perfect maze with a single path between any two points within the open cells, meaning only one solution exists from A to B. After generating the maze, a Breadth-First Search (BFS) was performed from an initial open cell to find the farthest reachable cell, which was designated as B. The initial cell was designated as A. Another BFS was then used to reconstruct the shortest path between A and B, which was marked with '.' characters. The length of this path was verified to be at least 10% of the total maze area (256 cells, so >= 26 cells). The maze is 'watertight' with walls ('#') on the border. Any remaining untaken paths are marked with a space (' '). A and B are guaranteed to be within the maze and on valid path cells.", 'maze': '################\n#A. . # # # #  #\n#.#.#.######### #\n#.#. . . . . . # #\n#.#.###.#.###.# #\n#.#.#. . .# . . #\n#. . .#.#.#.###.#\n# #.###.#. . . .#\n# #. . . .# # # #\n# #######.# # # #\n# #. . . . . . # #\n# #.# #######. .#\n# . . # # # .#. #\n# # . . . . .#B #\n# ########### # #\n################'}
