{'reasoningAndDiscussion': "The core challenge is to represent Australia's landmass, including Tasmania, as a parametric shape while adhering to strict byte limits and specific Mercator projection and scaling requirements. The function `f(x,y)` must return `> 0` for 'inside' and `<= 0` for 'outside'.\n\n1.  **Mercator Projection & Normalization:**\n    The problem requires a Mercator projection and scaling such that specific geographical points map to the corners of the `[0,1]x[0,1]` normalized square.\n    -   `x` in `[0,1]` maps to `longitude` in `[113.1, 153.6]` (Steep Point to Cape Byron).\n    -   `y` in `[0,1]` maps to `Mercator_y` from `Mercator_y(Cape York's Lat)` to `Mercator_y(South East Cape's Lat)`.\n    The standard Mercator `y` coordinate is `log(tan(PI/4 + lat_radians/2))`. Since Southern Hemisphere latitudes are negative, more southerly points have more negative Mercator `y` values. Cape York (-10.7°) is less negative than South East Cape (-43.6°). Therefore, `y=0` corresponds to `Mercator_y(Cape York)` and `y=1` corresponds to `Mercator_y(South East Cape)`.\n    The inverse Mercator projection is used to convert the normalized `y` back to `latitude`.\n\n2.  **Shape Representation:**\n    To define the landmass within the tight byte limit, a highly simplified shape is necessary. A union of two ellipses (implemented as `max(ellipse1_func, ellipse2_func)`) provides the simplest parametric representation. One large ellipse for the main Australian continent and a smaller one for Tasmania are used. The `ellipse_func` is `1 - ((lon-cx)/rx)^2 - ((lat-cy)/ry)^2`. This expression is `> 0` when `(lon,lat)` is inside the ellipse, and `<= 0` when outside or on the boundary. This directly satisfies the `f(x,y) > 0` for 'inside' requirement.\n\n3.  **Parameter Tuning:**\n    The centers (`cx`, `cy`) and radii (`rx`, `ry`) of the ellipses were chosen by trial and error to approximately cover the landmass and ensure the key extreme points (Cape York, Steep Point, Cape Byron) fall within the continent ellipse. Tasmania's ellipse is placed to cover the island.\n\n4.  **Byte Optimization:**\n    -   Using `m=math` and then `m.pi`, `m.log`, etc., saves bytes compared to repeatedly typing `math.pi`.\n    -   Assigning short variable names (`P`, `L`, `T`, etc.) to `math` functions further reduces character count.\n    -   Compressing constants and intermediate calculations into single lines.\n    -   Defining a helper function `S` for the ellipse calculation reduces repetition. \n    The final code is well under the 1024-byte limit.\n\n5.  **No Comments / Newlines:**\n    The `minifiedCode` output is provided as a single string without comments or control characters, as requested.", 'minifiedCode': 'def f(x,y):m=math;P=m.pi;L=m.log;T=m.tan;R=m.radians;D=m.degrees;E=m.exp;A=m.atan;mLo=113.1;MLo=153.6;CLa=-10.7;SLa=-43.6;YMC=L(T(P/4+R(CLa)/2));YMS=L(T(P/4+R(SLa)/2));DL=MLo-mLo;DY=YMS-YMC;lo=mLo+x*DL;ym=YMC+y*DY;la=D(2*(A(E(ym))-P/4));def S(cx,cy,rx,ry,lo,la):return 1-((lo-cx)/rx)**2-((la-cy)/ry)**2;return max(S(133.5,-25,25,20,lo,la),S(147,-42,3,2.5,lo,la))'}
