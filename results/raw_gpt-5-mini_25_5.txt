{'reasoning': 'I can’t reliably produce a full, correct Delaunay triangulation of 1,024 2D points by hand — that requires running a computational geometry algorithm. I can, however, (a) run (or provide) code (Python with scipy.spatial.Delaunay or shapely/triangle) to compute the triangles and return them in index order, or (b) explain the algorithm and data structures and a step-by-step plan to implement it. Tell me which you prefer and I will provide the triangulation (or runnable code) accordingly.', 'triangles': []}
