You are an AI in charge of navigating a spaceship in orbit.

You are currently at [-1845.998197, -6653.941516, -3451.314228] km (in a LEO orbit 1348.73 km above the earths surface) travelling with velocity [4.30553, 1.936911, -5.512077] km/s and the mission timer just got set to a 0 second epoch.

You are given a list of 10 space stations in orbit, and have to plan a path for a spaceship 
to visit all of them. You need to calculate this route exactly and should use all relevant tools available to you.

Your goal is to minimise Delta-V used for this journey, not time or distance. If a new route takes an extra decade 
and travels a billion more km around the earth, but it saves a drop of fuel, it is a better route.

You may assume:
- The spacecraft is a point mass.
- All coordiantes are Earth-centred inertial (GCRF/J2000) coordinates.
- Your spaceship mass does not change as fuel is expended, and all thrusts are instantaneous.
- Your engine has no maximum impulse and your spacecraft's burns have no maximum delta-V.
- All units are SI except distances, which are in km.
- Rendevous are of duration that is short enough to be considered instantaneous.
- Rndevous does not transfer momentum between spacecraft.
- Two craft must pass within .1km of each other with relative speeds < 0.005km/s in order to successfully rendezvous.
- The earth is a perfect sphere with radius 6371km.
- The moon, sun, and rest of the solar system do not affect the spacecraft.
- The atmosphere does not affect any spacecraft above 100km altitude. Below 100km the spacecraft is destroyed instantly.

Here are the orbits you need to visit: (Of the format [Pos X, Y, Z, Vel X, Y, Z] at the same epoch as your mission timer T=0)
