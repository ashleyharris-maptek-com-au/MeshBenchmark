{'reasoning': "The problem asks for a function f(x,y) that returns a positive value for coordinates marked '#' and a non-positive value for '.'. Analyzing the grid, the boundary x-value depends on y. The maximum x for '#' at each row y (0 to 7) is: 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. This means f(x,y) > 0 for x <= T(y) and f(x,y) <= 0 for x > T(y), where T(y) is the threshold sequence. This can be reformulated as P(y) - x > 0 where P(y) approx T(y) + 0.5. We fit a polynomial P(y) to the values 2.5, 1.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 6.5, 7.5. To use integers, we scale by 5040 (LCM of denominators needed for Lagrange-like interpolation). The base quadratic y^2 - 3y + 5 fits the first 4 points (scaled) and we add a correction term using the basis y(y-1)(y-2)(y-3) to fit the remaining points. The derived formula ensures correct discrimination for all integer coordinates in the 8x8 grid.", 'function': 'def f(x, y): return 2520*(y**2 - 3*y + 5 - 2*x) + y*(y-1)*(y-2)*(y-3)*(-2*(y-4)**3 - 8*(y-4)**2 + 94*(y-4) - 210) - 1'}
