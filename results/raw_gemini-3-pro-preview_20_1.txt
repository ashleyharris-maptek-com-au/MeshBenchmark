{'reasoningAndDiscussion': "I have defined a parametric shape for Australia by manually selecting key geographic coordinates (Cape York, Cape Byron, South East Cape, Steep Point, and intermediate coastal features) and projecting them onto a normalized Mercator grid. The latitude/longitude bounds were mapped to a 0-100 coordinate system, where y=0 corresponds to the northernmost point (Cape York) and y=1 (or 100 in the grid) to the southernmost (SE Cape), satisfying the screen-coordinate orientation (y increasing downwards). The Mainland and Tasmania are defined as lists of integer vertices. The function `f(x,y)` scales the input to this grid and performs a ray-casting point-in-polygon test (Jordan curve theorem) to determine containment. The result is calculated by counting edge crossings; an odd count implies 'inside'. The implementation handles both landmasses and returns 1 for inside and -1 for outside.", 'minifiedCode': 'def f(x,y):\n u,v=x*100,y*100;P=[73,0,82,15,91,30,99,46,100,51,96,62,90,78,82,84,75,80,65,74,55,65,45,61,30,62,15,68,5,69,2,60,0,44,2,32,15,25,25,20,44,6,55,5,62,25,68,5];T=[78,88,86,88,83,100,81,100];r=0\n for S in P,T:\n  j=len(S)-2\n  for i in range(0,len(S),2):\n   X,Y=S[i],S[i+1];A,B=S[j],S[j+1]\n   if(Y>v)!=(B>v):\n    if u<(A-X)*(v-Y)/(B-Y)+X:r^=1\n   j=i\n return r*2-1'}
