{'reasoning': 'Approximates the given block by a diamond-like region defined via four linear inequalities in (x,y): 14 <= x+y <= 29 and -8 <= x-y <= 1. A polynomial is built as a product of corresponding linear factors plus a couple of additive fallback terms so that boundary points yield positive values and an exterior point far away yields negative values. This yields a single expression without any extra variables or conditionals.', 'function': 'def f(x, y):\n    return (x + y - 14) * (29 - (x + y)) * (x - y + 8) * (1 - (x - y)) + (x + y - 14) * (29 - (x + y)) + (x - y + 8) * (1 - (x - y))'}
