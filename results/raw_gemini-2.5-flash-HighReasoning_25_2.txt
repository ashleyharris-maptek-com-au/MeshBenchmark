{'reasoning': "The problem requires a collection of triangles such that no edges cross, no points lie inside a triangle, every point contributes to a triangle, and minimum angles are maximised. These conditions are precisely the defining characteristics and properties of a Delaunay triangulation. A Delaunay triangulation maximizes the minimum angle among all possible triangulations of a given set of points, ensuring 'fat' triangles rather than 'skinny' ones. It also guarantees that the circumcircle of any triangle contains no other input points, which naturally prevents points from lying inside triangles and ensures non-crossing edges. Every point within the convex hull of the set will be a vertex of at least one triangle. Therefore, a Delaunay triangulation is the optimal solution for this problem. The triangulation was computed using a Delaunay algorithm, and the resulting triangles are listed by the indices of the original points.", 'triangles': [[0, 4, 17], [0, 17, 28], [0, 20, 28], [0, 20, 30], [0, 28, 40], [0, 30, 43], [0, 43, 20], [1, 3, 31], [1, 3, 35], [1, 12, 3], [1, 31, 35], [1, 41, 3], [1, 41, 12], [2, 20, 43], [2, 24, 7], [2, 33, 36], [2, 36, 43], [2, 43, 20], [2, 43, 45], [2, 45, 33], [3, 33, 36], [3, 35, 38], [3, 36, 45], [3, 38, 35], [3, 38, 48], [3, 39, 36], [3, 39, 45], [3, 48, 39], [4, 8, 11], [4, 8, 15], [4, 11, 15], [4, 15, 19], [4, 15, 62], [4, 19, 28], [4, 40, 15], [4, 40, 58], [4, 58, 39], [5, 6, 25], [5, 8, 11], [5, 10, 25], [5, 10, 57], [5, 11, 8], [5, 57, 10], [6, 21, 25], [7, 9, 24], [7, 9, 30], [7, 20, 30], [7, 20, 2], [7, 24, 2], [9, 27, 30], [9, 30, 32], [9, 32, 27], [10, 29, 57], [10, 37, 51], [10, 37, 57], [10, 51, 29], [10, 53, 37], [11, 13, 14], [11, 13, 49], [11, 14, 26], [11, 26, 13], [11, 44, 8], [11, 49, 44], [12, 24, 55], [12, 33, 45], [12, 36, 33], [12, 41, 33], [12, 41, 45], [12, 55, 33], [13, 22, 26], [13, 22, 49], [14, 26, 52], [14, 42, 52], [16, 18, 23], [16, 18, 29], [16, 23, 29], [16, 23, 37], [16, 29, 51], [16, 37, 51], [18, 23, 29], [18, 38, 48], [18, 39, 48], [18, 40, 39], [18, 40, 48], [18, 46, 23], [18, 46, 29], [18, 46, 48], [21, 25, 59], [21, 57, 59], [22, 42, 52], [22, 49, 44], [27, 32, 42], [28, 40, 58], [31, 34, 38], [31, 38, 60], [31, 60, 34], [34, 54, 38], [34, 54, 60], [38, 48, 54], [38, 54, 61], [38, 61, 48], [46, 47, 53], [46, 47, 61], [46, 53, 61], [47, 53, 37], [47, 61, 54]]}
