{'reasoning': "To find nodes that touch a vertex, but not an edge or a face, to the node '001101', we need to identify nodes that are adjacent in all three dimensions (X, Y, Z) simultaneously. This implies that the intersection of the two nodes' coordinate ranges must be a single point (a vertex).\n\nFirst, let's determine the coordinate ranges for the target node '001101' based on the provided split dimensions:\n- Split dimensions: D0=Z, D1=Z, D2=Z, D3=X, D4=Y, D5=Z\n- Target path: P_T = '001101'\n\nTracing the path '001101':\n- Initial Cube: X:[0,1], Y:[0,1], Z:[0,1]\n- D0 (Z, '0'): Z becomes [0, 0.5]\n- D1 (Z, '0'): Z becomes [0, 0.25]\n- D2 (Z, '1'): Z becomes [0.125, 0.25]\n- D3 (X, '1'): X becomes [0.5, 1]\n- D4 (Y, '0'): Y becomes [0, 0.5]\n- D5 (Z, '1'): Z becomes [0.1875, 0.25]\n\nSo, the target node '001101' occupies the space: X:[0.5, 1], Y:[0, 0.5], Z:[0.1875, 0.25].\n\nFor a node to touch '001101' only at a vertex, it must:\n1. Be of the same depth (path length 6) as '001101'. If it were an ancestor, descendant, or sibling of different depth, it would touch on an edge or face, or enclose it.\n2. Have coordinate ranges that are immediately adjacent to '001101' in all three dimensions, meaning their intervals meet exactly at an endpoint for each dimension.\n\nTo achieve this, we need to identify the *last split decision* in the path '001101' for each dimension (X, Y, Z) that defines its final extent. Then, we flip only these specific bits in the path to generate the vertex-adjacent neighbor:\n\n- For X-dimension: The only X-split is at index D3. P_T[3] = '1'. (X range defined as [0.5, 1]).\n- For Y-dimension: The only Y-split is at index D4. P_T[4] = '0'. (Y range defined as [0, 0.5]).\n- For Z-dimension: The Z-splits occur at D0, D1, D2, D5. The *last* Z-split affecting the final range is at index D5. P_T[5] = '1'. (Z range defined as [0.1875, 0.25]).\n\nNow, we construct the path for the vertex-touching node (P_V) by flipping these 'last relevant' bits:\n- P_V[3] = 1 - P_T[3] = 1 - '1' = '0'\n- P_V[4] = 1 - P_T[4] = 1 - '0' = '1'\n- P_V[5] = 1 - P_T[5] = 1 - '1' = '0'\n\nAll other bits in the path P_V must remain the same as P_T to ensure adjacency only at the boundary and not overlap or miss:\n- P_V[0] = P_T[0] = '0'\n- P_V[1] = P_T[1] = '0'\n- P_V[2] = P_T[2] = '1'\n\nCombining these, the path for the vertex-adjacent node is '001010'.\n\nLet's verify the coordinates for '001010':\n- D0 (Z, '0'): Z becomes [0, 0.5]\n- D1 (Z, '0'): Z becomes [0, 0.25]\n- D2 (Z, '1'): Z becomes [0.125, 0.25]\n- D3 (X, '0'): X becomes [0, 0.5]\n- D4 (Y, '1'): Y becomes [0.5, 1]\n- D5 (Z, '0'): Z becomes [0.125, 0.1875]\n\nSo, '001010' occupies the space: X:[0, 0.5], Y:[0.5, 1], Z:[0.125, 0.1875].\n\nComparing '001101' (X:[0.5, 1], Y:[0, 0.5], Z:[0.1875, 0.25]) and '001010' (X:[0, 0.5], Y:[0.5, 1], Z:[0.125, 0.1875]):\n- X-dimension: [0, 0.5] and [0.5, 1] touch at X=0.5.\n- Y-dimension: [0.5, 1] and [0, 0.5] touch at Y=0.5.\n- Z-dimension: [0.125, 0.1875] and [0.1875, 0.25] touch at Z=0.1875.\n\nThe intersection is a single point (0.5, 0.5, 0.1875), confirming it is a vertex-only touch. No other node of the same depth can satisfy these conditions, as flipping any other bit or combination of bits would result in an overlap in at least one dimension or no touch at all.", 'nodes': ['001010']}
