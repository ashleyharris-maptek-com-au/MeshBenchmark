{'reasoning': 'The scene consists of 5 cubes arranged in a pentagram. The view is orthographic from the North-East, looking down at 45 degrees. The coordinate system is defined such that the pentagram lies in the XY plane centered at the origin, pointing North (+Y). The camera looks towards the origin from a position with x>0, y>0, z>0. The basis vectors for the projection are derived, and the bounding box of the projected scene is calculated to fit the 32x32 canvas. The visible faces of the cubes from this angle are the Top (#), East (") and North (\') faces. The image is generated by sampling the projected geometry at the center of each pixel.', 'painting': '               ##               \n              ####              \n             ######             \n             "####\'             \n             ""##\'\'             \n             ""##\'\'             \n              "\'\'           ##  \n                           #### \n                          ######\n                          "####\'\n    ##                    ""##\'\'\n   ####                   ""##\'\'\n  ######                   "\'\'  \n  "####\'                        \n  ""##\'\'                        \n  ""##\'\'                        \n   "\'\'              ##          \n                   ####         \n                  ######        \n                  "####\'        \n                  ""##\'\'        \n                  ""##\'\'        \n                   "\'\'          \n          ##                    \n         ####                   \n        ######                  \n        "####\'                  \n        ""##\'\'                  \n        ""##\'\'                  \n         "\'\'                    \n                                \n                                '}
