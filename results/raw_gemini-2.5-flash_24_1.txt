{'reasoning': 'The problem asks for the points that form the convex hull of the given set of 2D points. This is a classic computational geometry problem. I will use the Monotone Chain algorithm (a variant of Graham Scan) to find the convex hull.\n\nSteps:\n1.  **Represent points**: Each point is stored as a tuple `(x, y, original_index)`.\n2.  **Sort points**: Sort all points lexicographically: first by x-coordinate, then by y-coordinate. This ensures that the leftmost point (and if ties, the lowest of them) is first, and the rightmost point (and if ties, the highest of them) is last.\n3.  **Build Lower Hull**: Iterate through the sorted points. Maintain a stack (list) called `lower`. For each point `p`, while the stack has at least two points and the turn formed by the last two points on the stack and `p` is a non-right turn (i.e., a left turn or collinear), pop the last point from the stack. Then push `p` onto the stack. This constructs the lower chain of the convex hull in left-to-right order.\n    *   Orientation check: For three points `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, calculate `cross_product = (p2.x - p1.x) * (p3.y - p1.y) - (p2.y - p1.y) * (p3.x - p1.x)`. If `cross_product > 0`, `p3` is to the left (counter-clockwise) of `p1->p2`. If `< 0`, `p3` is to the right (clockwise). If `= 0`, they are collinear. For the lower hull, we want right turns, so we pop if `cross_product <= 0`.\n4.  **Build Upper Hull**: Iterate through the sorted points in reverse order. Maintain a stack (list) called `upper`. For each point `p`, while the stack has at least two points and the turn formed by the last two points on the stack and `p` is a non-right turn (i.e., a left turn or collinear), pop the last point from the stack. Then push `p` onto the stack. This constructs the upper chain of the convex hull in right-to-left order.\n    *   The same `cross_product <= 0` condition is used for popping, as we are traversing the points in reverse and want a ', 'pointSequence': [1, 8, 17, 11, 4, 18, 22, 13, 5]}
