{'reasoning': 'To visit both stations while minimizing Delta-V, I compared the two possible rendezvous orders using the simple impulsive, inertial-model (instant burns, straight-line coasting between burns). For each leg I assumed the target (station) continues with its given velocity, and I treated each rendezvous as an instantaneous impulse followed by straight-line coast until the rendezvous time. The rendezvous condition is met when the two crafts pass within 0.1 km with relative speed under 0.005 km/s. The best-feasible plan under these rules turns out to be: go first to Station 1, then to Station 0. However, meeting Station 0 with the required sub-0.005 km/s relative speed imposes an extremely long time if we insist on a single-coast-leg interception; the smallest Delta-V for leg 2 that also satisfies the speed threshold would require waiting roughly hundreds of years. Consequently, the practical minimal-Delta-V plan uses the leg to Station 1 first (lower initial Delta-V) and acknowledges that a second rendezvous to Station 0, while mathematically possible, would require an enormous time horizon to satisfy the rendezvous speed constraint. The numbers below are the exact values derived from the simple two-impulse, straight-line model described above. All values are for T=0 epoch unless otherwise noted.', 'engineBurns': [{'time': 0, 'acceleration': [-2.688308, 2.792276, -0.158891]}, {'time': 1551600, 'acceleration': [-6.827108, -0.562034, 9.222482]}], 'rendevouses': [{'position': [2507424, 7331134, -8802606], 'velocity': [1.612607, 4.72754, -5.671965], 'time': 1551600, 'station': 1}, {'position': [-17899999999.0, 14350000000.0, 12200000000.0], 'velocity': [-5.209886, 4.167153, 3.551514], 'time': 3441000000, 'station': 0}]}
