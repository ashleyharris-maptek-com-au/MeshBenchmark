{'reasoning': 'To find nodes that touch a vertex, but not an edge or a face, to the given node "001101", we must find nodes that are \'corner-adjacent\' in all three dimensions (X, Y, Z). This implies that for each dimension, the neighboring node must be adjacent to the target node\'s boundary in that dimension, and its corresponding interval must be of the same size. This means the neighbor node will have the same number of subdivisions for each dimension (same depth for X_path, Y_path, Z_path).\n\nFirst, let\'s determine the X, Y, and Z dimensional paths for the target node "001101" based on the provided splitting sequence:\n- Dimension split order: Z, X, Y, Z, X, Y (for levels 0 to 5)\n\nTarget node P = "001101":\n- Level 0 (Z): Path digit \'0\'. Z_path = "0"\n- Level 1 (X): Path digit \'0\'. X_path = "0"\n- Level 2 (Y): Path digit \'1\'. Y_path = "1"\n- Level 3 (Z): Path digit \'1\'. Z_path = "01" (from \'0\' then \'1\')\n- Level 4 (X): Path digit \'0\'. X_path = "00" (from \'0\' then \'0\')\n- Level 5 (Y): Path digit \'1\'. Y_path = "11" (from \'1\' then \'1\')\n\nSo, for node P: X_path="00" (depth 2), Y_path="11" (depth 2), Z_path="01" (depth 2).\n\nNext, we find the valid adjacent dimensional paths for each axis that represent a single \'flip\' from the original node\'s boundary and stay within the [0,1] unit cube:\n- For X_path="00": This covers the range [0, 0.25]. It only has a neighbor on the \'1\' side (upper X direction). The neighbor X_path would be "01" (range [0.25, 0.5]).\n- For Y_path="11": This covers the range [0.75, 1]. It only has a neighbor on the \'0\' side (lower Y direction). The neighbor Y_path would be "10" (range [0.5, 0.75]).\n- For Z_path="01": This covers the range [0.25, 0.5]. It has neighbors on both the \'0\' side (lower Z direction) and the \'1\' side (upper Z direction).\n  - \'0\' side neighbor Z_path: "00" (range [0, 0.25]).\n  - \'1\' side neighbor Z_path: "10" (range [0.5, 0.75]).\n\nTo touch a vertex but not an edge or a face, the neighbor node must be \'opposite\' to the target node in all three dimensions. This means we take the single valid neighbor for X (always \'1\' side), the single valid neighbor for Y (always \'0\' side), and both possibilities for Z.\n\nThis gives us two combinations of dimensional paths for the vertex-touching neighbors:\n1. X_neighbor_path="01", Y_neighbor_path="10", Z_neighbor_path="00"\n2. X_neighbor_path="01", Y_neighbor_path="10", Z_neighbor_path="10"\n\nFinally, we reconstruct the full node paths from these dimensional paths by following the original splitting sequence (Z, X, Y, Z, X, Y):\n\n**Node 1 (from X="01", Y="10", Z="00")**:\n- Level 0 (Z): Z_path[0] = \'0\'. Full path: "0"\n- Level 1 (X): X_path[0] = \'0\'. Full path: "00"\n- Level 2 (Y): Y_path[0] = \'1\'. Full path: "001"\n- Level 3 (Z): Z_path[1] = \'0\'. Full path: "0010"\n- Level 4 (X): X_path[1] = \'1\'. Full path: "00101"\n- Level 5 (Y): Y_path[1] = \'0\'. Full path: "001010"\n   **Node 1: "001010"**\n\n**Node 2 (from X="01", Y="10", Z="10")**:\n- Level 0 (Z): Z_path[0] = \'1\'. Full path: "1"\n- Level 1 (X): X_path[0] = \'0\'. Full path: "10"\n- Level 2 (Y): Y_path[0] = \'1\'. Full path: "101"\n- Level 3 (Z): Z_path[1] = \'0\'. Full path: "1010"\n- Level 4 (X): X_path[1] = \'1\'. Full path: "10101"\n- Level 5 (Y): Y_path[1] = \'0\'. Full path: "101010"\n   **Node 2: "101010"**\n\nThese are the two nodes that touch a vertex, but not an edge or a face, to the node "001101".', 'nodes': ['001010', '101010']}
