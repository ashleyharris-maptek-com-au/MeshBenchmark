You are given a 3D space of dimensions 50 * 50 * 50 meters, and have to build a rollercoaster track that
meets the following requirements:

- Starts at altitude Z = 48 meters
- Minimum track length: 500
- Must exceed a speed of at least: 15
- Must not exceed a speed of 40m/s
- Once up to speed, must not drop below a speed of 5m/s
- Must finish at altitude Z = 0 meters
- Must not use any acceleration other than Earth's gravity.
- Must not exceed 5G acceleration when turning.

Any track below z = 5 must avoid x,y=25,25 by a 10m margin

Track segments are represented by a list of points, where each point is a list of [x, y, z] coordinates.

Track layout must follow these rules:
- No segment longer than 1.8m.
- No segment shorter than 90cm
- The angle between 2 segments must not exceed 10 degrees.
- When crossing existing track, a vertical clearence of 3m minimum is required.
- All track segments must be within 0,0,0 -> 50,50,50

You do not need to consider support positions at this stage of the planning.

Assume frictionless vacuum for all track segments except vertical loops. 
A full 360 degree vertical loop results in a halving of speed.

Return the track as a list of points, where each point is a list of [x, y, z] coordinates.
