{'reasoning': 'I interpreted the view and arranged five cubes roughly according to the requested layout. I produced an orthographic-style 64×64 canvas (as a multiline string) showing each cube\'s visible faces: \'#\' for the top faces, \'"\' for east-facing (right) faces, and \'\\\'\' for north-facing (top) faces.
