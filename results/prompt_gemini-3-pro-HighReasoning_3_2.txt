You can output polyhedrons in a json format. This is a simple cube, every face has 4 vertices, and there are 6 faces:

{
"polyhedron":
  {
    "vertex":[{"xyz":[-1.0,-1.0,-1.0]},{"xyz":[1.0,-1.0,-1.0]},{"xyz":[1.0,1.0,-1.0]},{"xyz":[-1.0,1.0,-1.0]},{"xyz":[-1.0,-1.0,1.0]},{"xyz":[1.0,-1.0,1.0]},{"xyz":[1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"xyz":[-1.0,1.0,1.0]}],
    "faces":[{"vertex":[3,2,1,0]},{"vertex":[4,5,6,7]},{"vertex":[0,1,5,4]},{"vertex":[7,6,2,3]},{"vertex":[3,0,4,7]},{"vertex":[1,2,6,5]}}]
  }
}

Now you've learnt the format, use it to solve the following problem:

You are given a solid rectangular prism of size 10cm * 20cm * 30cm, translated such that it's centre of mass is at 15cm, 5cm, 5cm.

You are also given a solid cube with single side dimension 15cm, translated such that it's centre of mass is at -15cm, -5cm, -5cm.

Return a polyhedron that is the union of the two solid objects. 
- Ensure faces have normals encoded in a consistent direction.
- Ensure no geometry occurs inside the polyhedron, and no faces cross through it.
- Note that some faces may have more than 4 vertices.
- Your output should have no degenerate faces or redundant vertices. 
- The task is a failure if the output is not watertight.
