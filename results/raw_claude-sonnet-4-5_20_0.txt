{'reasoningAndDiscussion': "To create a parametric representation of Australia within 1024 bytes, I need to:\n\n1. Use a Mercator projection to convert lat/lon to x/y coordinates\n2. Define Australia's shape using key boundary points\n3. Create a function that determines if a point is inside the shape\n4. Include Tasmania as required\n5. Normalize to 0,0 -> 1,1\n\nApproach:\n- Use a polygon representation with key points around Australia's coastline\n- Include Tasmania as a separate polygon\n- Use point-in-polygon algorithm (ray casting)\n- Mercator: x = lon, y = log(tan(π/4 + lat/2))\n- Normalize by finding bounds and scaling\n\nKey coastal points (approximate lat,lon):\n- Northern coast: Cape York, Darwin area, northern WA\n- Eastern coast: Queensland, NSW, Victoria\n- Southern coast: SA, western Victoria\n- Western coast: WA coastline\n- Tasmania\n\nTo save bytes:\n- Use single letter variables\n- Combine operations\n- Use numpy for efficient polygon checking\n- Minimize whitespace\n- Use list comprehensions\n- Hard-code Mercator-projected and normalized coordinates directly", 'minifiedCode': 'def
