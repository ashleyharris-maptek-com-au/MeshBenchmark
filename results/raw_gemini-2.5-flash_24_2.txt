{'reasoning': "To determine which points the rubber band touches, we need to find the convex hull of the given set of 2D points. The Monotone Chain (Andrew's algorithm) is an efficient method for this. First, the points are augmented with their original indices and sorted lexicographically (by x-coordinate, then by y-coordinate). Then, two hulls are constructed: an upper hull and a lower hull. The upper hull is built by iterating through the sorted points, maintaining a stack and removing points that would form a clockwise or collinear turn (i.e., not a counter-clockwise turn). The lower hull is built by iterating through the sorted points in reverse, also maintaining a stack and removing points that would form a counter-clockwise or collinear turn (i.e., not a clockwise turn). Finally, the upper hull and the lower hull are concatenated, omitting their duplicate start and end points (which correspond to the global minimum and maximum x-coordinates) to form the complete convex hull. The indices of these hull points are then extracted in order.", 'pointSequence': [1, 27, 36, 54, 5, 13, 22, 55, 11, 17, 56, 8]}
