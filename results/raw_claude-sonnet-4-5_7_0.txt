I need to create a 5x5 maze where:
- A is at height 5, B is at height 0
- Only one solution exists
- Path visits at least 20% of cells (at least 5 cells out of 25)
- At least 2 jumps are required
- Movement rules: step to adjacent cell if height diff ≤ 1, or jump 2 cells if same height with lower cell between

Let me design a maze with a forced path:

A5503
55403
04002
34042
345B0

Let me trace the solution:
- Start at A (0,0) height 5
- Move to (0,1) height 5
- Move to (1,1) height 5
- Move to (1,0) height 5
- Jump from (1,0) height 5 to (1,2) height 4 over (1,1)... wait, that doesn't work.

Let me reconsider:

A5005
55104
04043
01042
012B0

Trace:
- A at (0,0) h=5
- (0,1) h=5
- (1,1) h=5
- (1,0) h=5
- Jump to (3,0) h=0 over (2,0) h=0... needs same height
- This doesn't work well.

New approach:

A5545
05040
05040
05542
014B0

Trace from A(0,0) h=5:
- (0,1) h=5
- (0,2) h=5
- (0,3) h=4
- (1,3) h=4
- Jump to (3,3) h=4 over (2,3) h=4... no, must be lower between
- (2,3) h=5, (3,3) h=4 - step down
- (3,4) h=2
- (4,4) h=0 = B

Let me try again:

A5505
05040
05040
45502
314B0
