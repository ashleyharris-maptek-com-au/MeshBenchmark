A very fine sand in a laminar flow is falling from a 25NB pipe whose opening sits 200ft above the floor of a silo.

5 cubic yards are sitting in the silo at the start.
1500 cubic feet of sand is piped in from trucks.
Then a 100 cubic meters train is unloaded.
Then 20 drums of sand are emptied, each 44-gallons. (UK Imperial Gallons)

The grain size and moisture content results in an angle of repose of 33 degrees.

The silo is 10 yards in dimeter, and negligible internal wind / air current.

Return an OpenSCAD file containing the shape of the sand pile: Use metric within OpenSCAD. 1 unit = 1 meter.

Keep the OpenSCAD file as simple as possible, using the fewest number of lines possible. 

Do not output anything else than the OpenSCAD file, as commentary doesn't compile.
