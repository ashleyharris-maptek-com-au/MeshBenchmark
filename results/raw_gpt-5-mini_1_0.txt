{'reasoning': 'Use the given horizontal pipe as the H crossbar (centered at (0,0), length 5m). Make two vertical posts 10m high by stacking two 5m pipes end-to-end at x = -2.5 (left) and x = +2.5 (right). Each vertical post has one pipe centered at y = +2.5 (top half) and one at y = -2.5 (bottom half), rotation 90°. The crossbar ends (±2.5, 0) coincide with the joint between the two vertical pipe segments, so pipes only touch at their ends and the overall height goes from y = -5 to y = +5 (10 m).', 'pipes': [{'xCentre': 0, 'yCentre': 0, 'rotationDegrees': 0}, {'xCentre': -2.5, 'yCentre': 2.5, 'rotationDegrees': 90}, {'xCentre': -2.5, 'yCentre': -2.5, 'rotationDegrees': 90}, {'xCentre': 2.5, 'yCentre': 2.5, 'rotationDegrees': 90}, {'xCentre': 2.5, 'yCentre': -2.5, 'rotationDegrees': 90}]}
