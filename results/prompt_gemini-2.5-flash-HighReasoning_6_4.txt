Position 1000 voxels in a cubic grid of 24 voxels per side, such that the orthographic projection to all 3 planes is 
solid (no holes in the projection), and there are no trivial symmetries (rotations or reflections that leave the shape unchanged).

0,0,0 is the bottom left grid cell and indices increase up and to the right.
