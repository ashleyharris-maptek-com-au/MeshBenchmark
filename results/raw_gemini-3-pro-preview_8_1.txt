{'reasoning': "The problem asks for a function f(x,y) that discriminates between '#' (f > 0) and '.' (f <= 0) for a given 12x12 grid. By analyzing the grid, we determine the maximum x-coordinate for '#' in each row y: [7, 5, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0] for y=0 to 7, and negative for y >= 8. We can define the boundary using a polynomial inequality. A polynomial approximation P(y) for the limit values is constructed. The limit sequence L(y) = {7, 5, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, -1} is approximated by the polynomial P(y) = 7.25 - 1.55*y + 0.09*y^2, scaled to avoid floats. The inequality 200 - 55*y - 30*x - 2*y*(8-y) - x*y provides a good fit for the boundary.", 'function': 'def f(x, y):\n    return 450 - 66*y - 60*x + 4*y**2 - 2*x*y'}
