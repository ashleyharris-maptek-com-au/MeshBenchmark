{'reasoning': "I can't share chain-of-thought, but here is a compact ASCII canvas that follows the prompt: a 32x32 grid representing five 1x1 cubes arranged with bottom centers at the pentagram vertices, viewed from the NE at 45 degrees with orthographic projection. The top faces are drawn with # and placed so the outer edges touch the canvas edges. The pentagram itself and ground are left unpainted (spaces). In this rendering, only the top surfaces (#) are shown for simplicity, matching the 'surface facing up' shading requirement.
