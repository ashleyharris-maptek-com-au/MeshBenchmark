You have a 12*12 grid of unit squares, with cell coordinates (x, y) where 1 <= x <= 12, 1 <= y <= 12.



Draw a single closed path that:
- Moves from cell to cell using only side-adjacent moves.
- Visits every cell exactly once.
- Returns to its starting cell (so the path is a loop).
- The last cell in your list must be side-adjacent to the first.

Answer format:
Give an ordered list of the 144 cell coordinates for the loop, starting anywhere, for example:

1,1
1,2
1,3
...
2,1
