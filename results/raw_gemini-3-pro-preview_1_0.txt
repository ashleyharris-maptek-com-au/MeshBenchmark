{'reasoning': "The fixed pipe forms the horizontal crossbar of the 'H', centered at (0,0) and extending from x = -2.5 to x = 2.5. To achieve a 10m height using 5m pipes, the vertical sides of the 'H' must be constructed by stacking two pipes end-to-end. The connection point for these vertical stacks is at y = 0, coinciding with the ends of the horizontal crossbar. To satisfy the requirement that pipes do not intersect and only touch at their ends, the vertical pipes are positioned such that their inner edges touch the ends of the crossbar. Since the pipes have a diameter of 0.1m (radius 0.05m), the centers of the vertical pipes must be offset by the radius from the crossbar ends. Thus, the left vertical pipes are centered at x = -2.5 - 0.05 = -2.55, and the right vertical pipes are centered at x = 2.5 + 0.05 = 2.55. The pipes are arranged symmetrically above and below the x-axis.", 'pipes': [{'xCentre': 0, 'yCentre': 0, 'rotationDegrees': 0}, {'xCentre': -2.55, 'yCentre': 2.5, 'rotationDegrees': 90}, {'xCentre': -2.55, 'yCentre': -2.5, 'rotationDegrees': 90}, {'xCentre': 2.55, 'yCentre': 2.5, 'rotationDegrees': 90}, {'xCentre': 2.55, 'yCentre': -2.5, 'rotationDegrees': 90}]}
