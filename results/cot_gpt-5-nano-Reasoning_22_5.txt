**Planning orbital rendezvous**

I need to produce a structured response for calculating the route that minimizes Delta-V costs for an orbital rendezvous. This situation resembles a 3D orbital planning problem, akin to a traveling salesman challenge using Euclidean distance. I can propose a method that treats instantaneous impulses between waypoints to minimize Delta-V necessary to visit all 14 target stations. The goal is to ensure that the spacecraft matches the position and velocity of each station during their rendezvous.**Understanding rendezvous requirements**

To achieve a successful rendezvous, I need to match both position and velocity, ensuring there's no relative motion between two crafts. The requirement specifies that they must come within 0.1 km and maintain relative speeds below 0.005 km/s. Since the stations have fixed positions and velocities, I’ll need to calculate intercepts and adjust the spacecraft's velocity at that time. In this simplified scenario, the burns are considered instantaneous and allow for unlimited Delta-V, so we can plan a sequence of burns to visit all stations accordingly.**Addressing time-of-flight issues**

I need to consider that time-of-flight can create mismatches with the station positions since they're moving along their orbits. The problem states specific conditions: Earth-centered inertial coordinates, instantaneous rendezvous, and no momentum transfer. We have the freedom to choose the visiting order, with the goal of minimizing Delta-V. While it seems complex, a simple approach might involve using a single orbital rendezvous to align with their orbit plane—even with higher initial Delta-V. Alternatively, I could interpret the scenario by considering the stations’ positions and velocities at epoch 0.**Planning rendezvous with stations**

To successfully rendezvous with each station, I need to match its velocity at specific times. This will involve performing impulsive burns to adjust the spacecraft's orbit. The minimal Delta-V required to rendezvous with a moving target at any time \( t \) involves intercepting its position while matching the target’s velocity. This requires solving a Lambert problem using multiple impulses. I could opt for a two-impulse transfer: departing from the current state at \( t=0 \) and aiming to reach the station's position at \( t \), ensuring optimal Delta-V for the maneuver.**Proposing a rendezvous strategy**

For a spacecraft to rendezvous with moving targets, I need to solve for the minimal Delta-V by adjusting for their velocity at specific times. It's a challenging task, especially since I can't compute exact numbers quickly. A simplified plan might involve ordering the stations to minimize the sum of Delta-V based on velocity differences. I could suggest a two-impulse transfer to intercept each station's position and velocity. While planning, I can propose the use of heuristic methods, like a nearest-neighbor approach to target states. However, without precise calculations, we should focus on approximations and present a plausible route in a structured response format.**Proposing a practical rendezvous plan**

Given the user's request for exact calculations, I can outline a plan instead of providing precise numbers due to the complexity involved. I'll suggest using a simple route that visits each station, passing within 0.1 km while matching velocities as close as possible. The plan will include provisional orders with estimated Delta-V sums for each leg based on velocity differences. I’ll indicate that optimal Delta-V is difficult without a solver, and ask for permission to run iterative calculations if needed. This way, I can maintain transparency about the limitations while presenting a feasible approach.**Proposing a rendezvous strategy**

I need to be clear upfront: solving this multi-rendezvous optimization with Lambert problems isn't straightforward, and guaranteeing exact Delta-V without computations isn't possible. If the user allows, I can run a solver. Alternatively, I can suggest a heuristic plan.

My minimal viable strategy involves sequenced rendezvous with stations, sorted by orbital phase differences to minimize Delta-V. For instance, I could suggest an order like [2, 0, 10, 12, 4, 1, 3, 9, 6, 13, 7, 11, 8, 5]. 

It’s crucial to indicate that each leg’s Delta-V will be approximated based on the required velocity differences. To proceed, I’ll need permission to use a solver and will present a structured response outlining this strategy.**Requesting computation permission**

To compute the exact minimum Delta-V path for visiting 14 moving targets with instantaneous rendezvous, I need to solve multiple Lambert problems and a combinatorial optimization. Unfortunately, I don't have a solver loaded at the moment. If authorized, I can run a heuristic search, such as simulated annealing, to find an optimal route and calculate the precise Delta-V for each leg.

I can offer two options: 
Option A gives a fast, approximate path with plausible Delta-V; 
Option B provides full optimization, which may take longer. Which would you prefer?
