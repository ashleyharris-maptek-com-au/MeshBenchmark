{'reasoning': 'To find all points a rubber band touches, we need to compute the convex hull of the given points. I used the Monotone Chain algorithm (a variant of Graham Scan). First, all input points were processed to handle potential duplicate (x,y) coordinates. Points with identical coordinates were grouped, and their original IDs were retained. These unique geometric points were then sorted lexicographically (first by x-coordinate, then by y-coordinate). Two passes were made over the sorted unique points: one to build the upper hull and one for the lower hull. For both hulls, points were added to a temporary stack. During this process, for each new point, any preceding points on the stack that would form a non-left turn (i.e., a right turn or collinear segment) with the new point were removed (popped from the stack). This ensures that all points forming the convex boundary, including those lying on an edge (collinear), are captured. The upper hull extends from the leftmost point to the rightmost point, and the lower hull extends from the rightmost point back to the leftmost point. These two hulls were then combined, carefully removing duplicate start/end points to form a single, continuous counter-clockwise sequence of points on the convex hull. Finally, all original IDs associated with these hull points were collected, deduplicated (if a coordinate pair appeared multiple times with different IDs, all those IDs are included), and sorted numerically to produce the final point sequence.', 'pointSequence': [0, 1, 5, 8, 13, 17, 27, 34, 36, 41, 45, 48, 54, 55, 56, 58, 71, 73, 82, 86, 90, 92, 98, 101, 105, 109, 110, 117, 129, 132, 140, 147, 149, 150, 157, 159, 161, 167, 169, 172, 173, 178, 179, 181, 187, 191, 192, 197, 200, 203, 206, 213, 216, 218, 224, 226, 229, 231, 233, 235, 238, 239, 241, 246, 249, 250, 252, 255, 256, 257, 261, 267, 270, 275, 278, 281, 286, 290, 291, 293, 296, 305, 309, 311, 315, 317, 318, 320, 326, 327, 329, 332, 336, 337, 338, 342, 348, 355, 357, 361, 368, 369, 375, 376, 377, 379, 380, 382, 383, 387, 390, 393, 395, 396, 399, 403, 407, 408, 411, 412, 413, 415, 418, 420, 421, 424, 425, 429, 432, 435, 438, 444, 461, 463, 468, 470, 471, 472, 474, 475, 478, 486, 488, 491, 492, 494, 495, 497, 499, 500, 505, 508, 511]}
