{'reasoning': "Generating a fully valid 128x128 maze with a unique 1-cell-wide solution path and at least 10% of the grid as the solution, while ensuring no loops or branches and keeping A and B inside the border, is extremely impractical to craft reliably by hand. It is best produced by a small program that carves a perfect maze (a tree of passages) and then selects A and B far apart to guarantee a long solution path. If you want, I can provide code (in Python, for example) that generates such a maze and prints the 128x128 string. Please confirm if you'd like the generation script.", 'maze': ''}
