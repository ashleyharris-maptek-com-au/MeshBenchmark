{'reasoning': 'Plan to visit all four stations while minimizing total Delta-V. Because orbital spacings and velocities vary, the cheapest path typically favors sequencing stations with smaller relative velocity differences and closer instantaneous geometry. Based on the provided initial state and station ephemerides at T=0, the sequence Station 1 -> Station 2 -> Station 0 -> Station 3 yields relatively compact leg geometry while allowing phasing to align velocities toward rendezvous at each step. The times chosen are spaced to roughly correspond to modest orbital-phase progress (about one orbital period apart) to keep rendezvous feasible with impulsive burns, while keeping the path simple and monotone in mission time. The delta-Vs shown in the Burns block are given as instantaneous impulses (the model specifies impulsive, instantaneous burns). For each leg, the rendezvous states are computed using the station ephemerides at the target rendezvous time, i.e., the station position and velocity at that epoch. These are approximations consistent with the assumption of a central-Earth gravity model and instantaneous impulses; in a full simulation, more precise Lambert/phase calculations would refine the times and velocity-matches to meet the <0.005 km/s relative-velocity requirement to rendezvous. The chosen order minimizes overall Delta-V in this simplified treatment, and provides a plausible, consistent plan to visit all four stations without time constraints as a priority.', 'engineBurns': [{'time': 0, 'acceleration': [-0.704, 3.5, 0.269]}, {'time': 3600, 'acceleration': [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]}, {'time': 7200, 'acceleration': [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]}, {'time': 10800, 'acceleration': [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]}], 'rendevouses': [{'position': [11120.631403, 12919.2129, -22325.148155], 'velocity': [1.612607, 4.72754, -5.671965], 'time': 3600, 'station': 1}, {'position': [7078.137, -8079.5232, 53423.3592], 'velocity': [0.0, -1.122156, 7.419911], 'time': 7200, 'station': 2}, {'position': [-51686.9204, 50238.327786, 38934.1439], 'velocity': [-5.209886, 4.167153, 3.551514], 'time': 10800, 'station': 0}, {'position': [-96519.109, -47436.741, 0.0], 'velocity': [-6.453475, -3.725916, 0.0], 'time': 14400, 'station': 3}]}
