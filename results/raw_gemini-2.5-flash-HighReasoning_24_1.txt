{'reasoning': "The problem describes the behavior of a rubber band snapping around a set of points, which is a classic computational geometry problem known as finding the convex hull. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the given points. I used the Jarvis March (Gift Wrapping) algorithm to find the points that form this hull.1.  **Start Point Selection**: The algorithm begins by identifying the point with the minimum y-coordinate. If there's a tie, the point with the minimum x-coordinate among those is chosen. For the given points, P17 (35, 0) is the lowest-leftmost point.2.  **Iterative Hull Construction**: Starting from P17, the algorithm iteratively finds the next point on the hull in a counter-clockwise direction. For each current point on the hull, it iterates through all other points to find the 'next' point. The 'next' point is defined as the one such that all other points lie to the right (clockwise) or are collinear and closer to the current point, relative to the line segment formed by the current point and the candidate 'next' point. This is determined using the 2D cross product (orientation test).3.  **Termination**: The process continues until the algorithm returns to the starting point (P17), completing the convex hull.", 'pointSequence': [17, 11, 18, 22, 13, 5, 1, 8]}
