{'reasoning': "The grid displays a rotated elliptical shape (or possibly an egg shape due to asymmetry). I approximated the shape using a general quadratic form f(x,y) = K - (A(x-x0)^2 + B(y-y0)^2 + C(x-x0)(y-y0) + D(y-y0)). Based on the tips at (5,9) and (11,18), and the width at row 14, I derived coefficients A=10, B=18, C=-20 (negative because x,y are correlated), centered at (10,13). I added a linear term D=-25 to balance the different 'tightness' of the top and bottom tips. The threshold K was determined to be 240. Expanding 240 - [10(x-10)^2 + 18(y-13)^2 - 20(x-10)(y-13) - 25(y-13)] yields the polynomial.", 'function': 'def f(x, y):\n    return -1527 + 293*y - 60*x + 20*x*y - 10*x**2 - 18*y**2'}
