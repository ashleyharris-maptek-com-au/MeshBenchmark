{'reasoning': 'I interpreted the shell as a hemispherical shell (outer radius 170 mm, inner radius 150 mm) with the sphere center at the origin, and the hemisphere being the upper half (z >= 0). Each LEGO brick has a footprint of 32 mm by 16 mm on the XY plane and a height of 9.6 mm (the 32×16 footprint comes from the interlocked LEGO dimensions; the vertical dimension is 9.6). To fit into the annular cross-section at a given height z, bricks must be arranged with their 16 mm side radially (so the radial thickness is 16), and their 32 mm side tangentially along the local circumference. That orientation keeps bricks from overlapping the inner hole or the outer boundary, provided the brick centers lie in a narrow radial band: ri(z) + 8 <= r_center <= ro(z) - 8, where ri(z) = sqrt(150^2 - z^2) and ro(z) = sqrt(170^2 - z^2). The bottom layer at z_center ≈ 4.8 mm is the simplest demonstration: ro(4.8) ≈ 169.93 mm, ri(4.8) ≈ 149.92 mm, so a ring of radius ~160 mm with bricks oriented tangentially is feasible. A full hemispherical shell would require repeating such rings across ~18 layers (since 170 / 9.6 ≈ 17.7), each layer having bricks placed around the circle. The example bricks below illustrate a single ring in the bottom layer and serve as a starting pattern; a complete build would generate similar rings for successive z-layers to fill the hemisphere. The complete dataset would be generated programmatically by looping z-layers, computing ri(z) and ro(z), choosing an r_center inside [ri(z)+8, ro(z)-8], and placing bricks at angles around the circle with their long axis tangential and their 16 mm radial width pointing toward/away from the origin. If you’d like, I can supply a script to generate the full list of bricks layer by layer.', 'bricks': [{'Centroid': [160.0, 0.0, 4.8], 'RotationDegrees': 90}, {'Centroid': [80.0, 138.6, 4.8], 'RotationDegrees': 150}, {'Centroid': [-80.0, 138.6, 4.8], 'RotationDegrees': 210}, {'Centroid': [-160.0, 0.0, 4.8], 'RotationDegrees': 270}, {'Centroid': [-80.0, -138.6, 4.8], 'RotationDegrees': 330}, {'Centroid': [80.0, -138.6, 4.8], 'RotationDegrees': 30}]}
